The four workstreams include: 
•	Healthier Together initiative
•	Asthma: Community asthma advisors 
•	Epilepsy: Epilepsy Specialist Nurses (ESN) - Learning disabilities
•	Epilepsy: Mental Health - Child Wellbeing Practitioner (CWP)
Evaluation of each workstream is required to assess the effectiveness and impact of the services in improving outcomes for CYP with a focus on the Core20 Plus 5 for CYP to reduce health inequalities. Evaluation outputs will be shared with the NENC ICB Healthier & Fairer committee to aid future decision making about whether the programmes should be rolled out across the NENC region and potentially beyond. Requirements to inform these decisions include clinical impact, cost-effectiveness and reduction in health inequalities.
To make the most of the funding budget available, one evaluation partner will be commissioned to deliver the four separate evaluations. The commissioned evaluation partner will be responsible for working with the CHWN to fully develop the methodological protocol to deliver the evaluations.

Aims of the evaluations: 
The Healthier Together evaluation aims to assess the impact of the Healthier Together app online consultation on reducing primary care attendances, call wait times and appropriateness of GP access. In addition, the evaluation aims to understand the impact of the Healthier Together website, mobile app and Healthier Together champions on supporting families within underserved communities in the NENC in accessing Healthier Together, reducing parental anxiety and improve confidence to make informed decisions about when and where to access the healthcare system when their child is unwell.

The Asthma evaluation aims to assess the impact of the established asthma workstream on community asthma care and management in respect to prevention and post exacerbation in CYP. 

The Epilepsy ESN evaluation aims to assess the impact of the ESN post in supporting CYP with epilepsy, with a focus on those with LD/Autism/Complex medical needs and neurodiversity.

The Epilepsy CWP evaluation aims to assess the impact of the CWP post on access to mental health screening, assessment and mental health intervention for CYP with epilepsy.

The exhibition space is 150sq metres.

The exhibition will commemorate the eightieth anniversary of the end of the Burma campaign.  It will cover the Retreat from Burma in 1942, the resurgence and transformation of the British and Indian armies in India during 1943, as well as the effective campaigns against the Imperial Japanese during 1944-1945.  In particular, it will also highlight the role of the Indian soldiers who continued to serve across Southeast Asia long after the end of the Second World War. The Burma campaign is often called the 'Forgotten War' and the Fourteenth Army nicknamed the 'Forgotten Army'.  However, the really forgotten aspect of the war are the large numbers of Indian and African soldiers who fought in Burma and the exhibition will explore their contribution.

This initiative is intended to inform future commissioning decisions for sexual health services in City and Hackney, and potentially across the wider area including North East London (NEL) region and London.

Purpose of the Engagement

The purpose of this market engagement is to:

- Gather up-to-date information from pathology providers on current capabilities
and service models.

- Explore options for sexual health testing of samples from sexual health clinical
providers e.g. sexual health/ GUM clinics

- Explore options for near patient sexual health testing in clinical settings e.g.
laboratory diagnostics and near-patient testing (POCT) options such as ""pathology in a box"" and self-screening technologies (e.g. initial HIV reactive tests).

- Understand potential efficiencies and service improvements that might arise from testing integration across multiple Local authorities within London.

- Seek non-binding indicative pricing to support future planning and feasibility work.

We are also exploring whether to include primary care-based testing in the scope of this engagement, though no decision has been made on this yet.

Please note: This engagement is not a procurement exercise, and we are not proposing any changes to current pathology arrangements at this stage. However, we believe it is timely to explore future service models and technological advancements in this area.

Scope of Interest

The focus will be on:

- Understanding how the pathology pathway for the City and Hackney local clinics can be integrated with an external provider providing the testing functions.

- Opportunities for economies of scale from increased volumes of tests being provided

- Current licenced near-patient and rapid testing solutions

- Technical innovations for near patient and rapid testing solutions which are in development

- Logistics, result turnaround, and digital integration

- Potential benefits or limitations of wider geographical consolidation across NEL local authorities Engagement Event

We will be holding a briefing and QandA session for interested pathology providers and London-based sexual health commissioners:

Date: 23 RD , July 2025
Time: 9 -10am
Join via: https://meet.google.com/bfq-nojq-ywb

Next Steps

Following the engagement session, we expect to:

- Review responses from the market engagement questionnaire (which has been attached) to inform our strategic options and commissioning approach

Interested providers are encouraged to attend the briefing session and engage fully with this process. If you have any questions or wish to express early interest, please contact:

The chosen agency will be asked to plan a 5-month campaign using a potential mix of platforms/channels inc. outdoor billboards and/or transport for Phase 1, and paid for social media, online advertising such as Google Display adverts for Phase 2.
The agency will recommend how they think the campaign should be delivered for maximum impact within budget.
The tone of the campaign should ideally be empowering, informative, and action-oriented, with a touch of local relevance and positivity and will encourage residents to consider their behaviour with waste, through the lens of reuse.

This opportunity closes at 12:00 noon on Tuesday 1st July.

This Notice provides information of a future opportunity to provide a bus shelter supply, operation and maintenance service for bus shelter locations and infrastructure in the Swale Borough area in Kent.

Swale Borough Council (SBC) would like to engage with bus shelter providers in regard to supply, installation and maintenance of bus shelters, including some possible living roof shelters, for bus shelter infrastructure managed by SBC in the Swale area and to agree a preferred supplier and product as per SBC's specification.

SBC requests that interested suppliers express an interest in this opportunity and share their thoughts and expertise to assist SBC to determine and shape the specification. The solution can be a new design or based on an existing design used elsewhere. Integrated advertising within the shelters can be traditional posters or, subject to location agreement, digital media screens.

Providers that are interested but are not registered on the ProContract Portal should register at the following address in the first instance: https://procontract.due-north.com

The Council intends to hold a competitive tendering process during 2025/26, to secure these new bus shelters. It is the Council's aim to make the procurement process as easy as possible for bidders to complete. It is anticipated that the initial contract of supply and maintenance will run for approximately 5 years with the provision for an extension of up to 5 years, and a commencement date of April 2026.

Your expression of interest must be made via the ProContract Portal, by 12:00 noon on Tuesday 1st July.

We would be particularly interested to hear whether you think there is any potential for income generation for the Council through advertising, or whether there is scope to provide living roof shelters at particular locations.
