- **Too Distant** (>730 days): Score=0, REJECTED - "too_distant_future"

#### **Capability Matching Filters**
```python
class CapabilityFilters:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.required_skills = config['required_skills']    # ['digital_transformation']
        self.min_technical_overlap = config['min_technical_overlap'] # 2 terms minimum
        self.max_complexity_threshold = config['max_complexity_threshold'] # 7 max score
```

**Capability Assessment Categories**:

        self.excluded_regions = config['excluded_regions']    # ['Northern Ireland']
        self.remote_friendly = config['remote_friendly']      # True
        self.max_travel_distance = config['max_travel_distance'] # 200 miles
```

**Geographic Assessment Logic**:
- **Remote Delivery** Detected: Score=1.0, Reason="remote_delivery_supported"

    # Competition adjustment (inverse relationship)
    competition_adjustment = max(0.1, (10 - competition_level) / 10 * 0.3)
    
    # Value size adjustment
    value_adjustment = self.get_value_size_adjustment(tender_value)
    
    # Final probability (0.05 - 0.45 range)
    final_probability = min(max(
        base_probability + competition_adjustment + value_adjustment, 0.05
    ), 0.45)
