# L4: Project Requirements

## What HAIOS IS

HAIOS is a **multi-agent operational framework** that transforms documentation into working products.

```
INPUT:  Corpus of documents (specs, designs, requirements)
PROCESS: Team of agents collaborating by role
OUTPUT: Functional product (aligned to L0-L3 manifesto)
```

## The Portability Test

> Can you drop `.claude/haios/` into a fresh workspace with a corpus of docs and have it produce a working product?

This is the success criterion.

## Current Project: HAIOS Bootstrap

The first project is building HAIOS itself. The corpus is:
- L0-L3 manifesto (what "good" looks like)
- Architecture docs (S20, S22, S26)
- Epoch/Arc definitions

The product is: a portable multi-agent framework.
