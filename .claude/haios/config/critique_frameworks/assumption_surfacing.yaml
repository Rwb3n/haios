# E2-072: Critique Subagent - Assumption Surfacing Framework
# Default framework for surfacing implicit assumptions in designs

name: assumption_surfacing
version: "1.0"
description: "Surface implicit assumptions in designs before implementation"

# Categories of assumptions to examine
# Each category has a prompt that guides the critique agent
categories:
  - id: dependency
    label: "External Dependencies"
    prompt: "What external systems, APIs, or components does this assume will work?"

  - id: data
    label: "Data Assumptions"
    prompt: "What data availability, format, or quality is assumed?"

  - id: user_behavior
    label: "User/Agent Behavior"
    prompt: "What behaviors are assumed from users or other agents?"

  - id: environment
    label: "Environment"
    prompt: "What runtime environment characteristics are assumed?"

  - id: scope
    label: "Scope Boundaries"
    prompt: "What is assumed to be out of scope that might actually matter?"

# Output schema for critique results
# Critique agent MUST produce output matching this schema
output_schema:
  assumptions:
    - id: string          # Unique ID (A1, A2, ...)
      statement: string   # The assumption being made
      category: enum      # One of: dependency, data, user_behavior, environment, scope
      confidence: enum    # high, medium, low
      risk_if_wrong: string  # What happens if this assumption is wrong
      mitigation: string  # How to mitigate the risk
      related_requirement: string  # L4 requirement traceability (optional)
      related_deliverable: string  # Work item deliverable traceability (optional)

# Verdict rules - criteria for each verdict
# Critique agent evaluates assumptions against these rules
verdict_rules:
  BLOCK: "Any assumption with confidence=low and no mitigation"
  REVISE: "Any assumption with risk_if_wrong containing 'silent' or 'fail'"
  PROCEED: "All assumptions have mitigations or are high confidence"

# Gate integration (how this framework is used)
integration:
  phase: plan-validation-cycle.CRITIQUE
  trigger: pre-DO
  required: true  # Cannot skip critique in validation
