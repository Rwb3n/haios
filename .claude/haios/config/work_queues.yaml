# Work Queue Configuration (E2-290, INV-064 design)
# Provides typed queues with cycle-locking for structured work execution
version: "1.1"

# Queue type definitions
queue_types:
  fifo:
    ordering: "creation_date ASC"
  priority:
    ordering: "priority DESC, creation_date ASC"
  batch:
    phases: [plan_all, review, implement_all, validate_all]
  chapter_aligned:
    ordering: "chapter_priority DESC, priority DESC"

# Active queues
queues:
  # LIFECYCLES queue - E2.5 Priority (Session 307: Foundation first)
  # Per EPOCH.md: lifecycles arc is foundation, all other arcs depend on it
  lifecycles:
    type: fifo  # Ordered execution per dependency analysis
    items:
      - WORK-098  # Lifecycle Tooling Consumer Updates (BLOCKER - discovered S313, blocks 091/092)
      - WORK-081  # Cycle-as-Subagent Delegation Pattern (foundational)
      - WORK-088  # Phase Template Contracts (defines contracts before fracturing)
      - WORK-089  # Fracture Design Lifecycle Templates
      - WORK-090  # Fracture Implementation Lifecycle Templates
      - WORK-091  # Fracture Validation Lifecycle Templates
      - WORK-092  # Fracture Triage Lifecycle Templates
      - WORK-086  # Batch Mode (builds on lifecycle infrastructure)
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle, investigation-cycle, work-creation-cycle]
    rationale: "Session 307: Lifecycles arc is E2.5 foundation. All other arcs blocked until this completes."

  # QUEUE arc - E2.5 (depends on lifecycles)
  queue-arc:
    type: fifo
    items: []  # WORK-066 complete. Wiring work TBD after lifecycles.
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle]
    rationale: "Queue position wiring depends on lifecycle patterns."

  # CEREMONIES arc - E2.5 (depends on queue)
  ceremonies:
    type: priority
    items:
      - WORK-034  # Upstream Status Propagation
      - WORK-096  # Agent UX Test in DoD Validation
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle]
    rationale: "Ceremony implementations depend on queue and lifecycle patterns."

  # FEEDBACK arc - E2.5 (depends on ceremonies)
  feedback:
    type: priority
    items:
      - WORK-071  # Pre-Decomposition Review Gate Design
      - WORK-075  # System Audit as L4 Traceability Verification
      - WORK-082  # Epistemic Review Ceremony
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle, investigation-cycle]
    rationale: "Feedback loops depend on ceremony infrastructure."

  # ASSETS arc - E2.5 (can parallel with ceremonies)
  assets:
    type: priority
    items:
      - WORK-093  # Lifecycle Asset Types
      - WORK-097  # Plan Decomposition Traceability
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle]
    rationale: "Asset typing can parallel ceremony work."

  # PORTABILITY arc - E2.5 (lower priority)
  portability:
    type: priority
    items:
      - WORK-067  # Portable Schema Architecture Investigation
      - WORK-020  # Discoverability Architecture
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle, investigation-cycle]
    rationale: "Portability work can proceed when bandwidth allows."

  # Default queue - catch-all for unassigned work
  default:
    type: priority
    items: auto  # Populated from get_ready() excluding named queues
    allowed_cycles: [implementation-cycle, investigation-cycle, work-creation-cycle]

# Policies
policies:
  assignment:
    default_queue: lifecycles  # E2.5 focus: lifecycles first
    auto_batch_threshold: 3
  cross_arc:
    allowed: false  # Session 307: Stay in lifecycles until complete
  cycle_enforcement:
    strict: true
