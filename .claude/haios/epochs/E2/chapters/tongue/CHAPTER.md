# Chapter: Tongue

## Chapter Definition

**Chapter ID:** Tongue
**Epoch:** E2.2 (The Refinement)
**Name:** Cognitive Notation
**Status:** Planned
**Pressure:** [volumous] - thematic exploration

---

## Theme

How to signal pressure in a way the model reliably understands.

**Notation types:**
- RFC 2119: MUST, SHOULD, MAY (obligation modals)
- Operators: |>, ??, ∀, → (flow and logic)
- Pidgin: Cherry-pick from multiple languages

**Key insight:** The model has training priors on these notations. Use them as cognitive scaffolding.

| Document | Why Required |
|----------|--------------|
| `../../EPOCH.md` | Epoch-level architecture |

## Arcs

| Arc | Name | Status | Purpose |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| TBD | NotationStandard | Planned | Formalize the notation lexicon |
| TBD | SkillNotation | Planned | Apply notation to skill definitions |
| TBD | PidginValidation | Planned | Test notation vs NL degradation |

## Chapter Completion Criteria

- [ ] Notation lexicon formalized
- [ ] Skills use notation instead of prose
- [ ] Empirical evidence: notation degrades slower than NL
