# Observation: Decomposition Leakage - No Multi-Level Governance

## What Was Noticed

During WORK-040 (CH-002 StateDefinitions) closure review, operator identified that:

1. **Epoch decisions don't trace to chapters** - E2.4 Decision 4 (Critique as Hard Gate) wasn't explicitly assigned to any chapter. It could fall through the cracks.

2. **No batch critique at arc level** - Critique happens per-plan (work item level) only. No verification that the *set of chapters* covers all epoch decisions.

3. **DoD only exists at work item level** - No Definition of Done for Chapter, Arc, or Epoch completion. "All chapters done" ≠ "Arc objectives met".

4. **Pre-scaffold review missing** - Chapters get scaffolded and worked independently without verifying the decomposition is complete.

## The Pattern

We have governance for leaf nodes (work items) but not branch nodes (chapters, arcs, epochs). Decomposition happens without verification that decomposition is complete.

## Risk

When working through CH-001, CH-002, CH-003, CH-004 sequentially:
- Things that fall between chapters get missed
- Epoch decisions that weren't explicitly assigned get forgotten
- Each chapter assumes something is "someone else's chapter"

## Example

E2.4 EPOCH says: "Critique verdict must = PROCEED for DESIGN→PLAN and PLAN→DO transitions"

But:
- CH-002 StateDefinitions defines states and transitions but not transition gates
- CH-003 GovernanceRules is "implement rules per governed activity" - doesn't explicitly mention transition gates
- The critique-as-hard-gate requirement has no explicit chapter assignment

## Potential Investigation Scope

- Epoch Decision → Chapter traceability (mandatory field?)
- Arc-level critique before chapter work begins
- DoD cascade: Work → Chapter → Arc → Epoch
- Pre-decomposition review gate
