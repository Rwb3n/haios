# Observation: L5-execution.md Work DAG Uses Non-Existent Values

## What Was Observed

The L5-execution.md manifesto (.claude/haios/manifesto/L5-execution.md:76) defines a work DAG:
```
backlog → ready → in_progress → blocked → complete
```

Neither `ready` nor `blocked` exist in:
- TRD-WORK-ITEM-UNIVERSAL current_node values
- GovernanceLayer.VALID_TRANSITIONS

The manifesto describes a theoretical model that was never implemented.

## Impact

- Low - manifesto is descriptive documentation, not normative code
- Creates confusion when reading L5 vs actual implementation
- Part of the three-vocabulary conflict identified in WORK-065

## Suggested Action

- Update L5-execution.md to reflect actual implementation (GovernanceLayer values)
- Or document that L5 describes design intent, not current state
