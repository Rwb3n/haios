# Observation: Memory Synthesis Describes Non-Existent Artifacts

## What Was Observed

During INV-041 investigation, querying memory for "path constants architecture" returned synthesized insights (concepts 64209, 63257, 24425) confidently describing `haios.config.json` as a centralized path configuration file.

**This file does not exist.**

The memory synthesis correctly captured the *intent* from past discussions but presents it as if it were implemented reality.

## Why It Matters

1. **Epistemic confusion**: Future agents querying memory might assume haios.config.json exists and build on that assumption
2. **Synthesis vs implementation gap**: No way to distinguish "we discussed this" from "we built this"
3. **Trust erosion**: If memory confidently describes non-existent artifacts, agent trust in memory decreases

## Potential Solutions

1. **Epistemic labeling**: Synthesized concepts should indicate source type (discussion vs implementation)
2. **Ground truth verification**: Before synthesis, check if referenced artifacts exist
3. **Confidence weighting**: Lower confidence for synthesis from discussions vs code analysis
