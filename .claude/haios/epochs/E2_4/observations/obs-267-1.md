# Observation: plan-validation-cycle Phase Mapping Drift

## Definition

**ID:** obs-267-1
**Session:** 267
**Triage Status:** pending
**Potential Action:** bugfix

---

## Observation

The WORK-040 plan's phase-to-state mapping for plan-validation-cycle uses placeholder phase names:

```yaml
# From WORK-040 plan (line 306-309)
plan-validation-cycle/GATE1: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/GATE2: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/GATE3: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/GATE4: CHECK
```

But the actual plan-validation-cycle skill has 5 phases:
- CHECK
- SPEC_ALIGN
- CRITIQUE
- VALIDATE
- APPROVE

The mapping should be:
```yaml
plan-validation-cycle/CHECK: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/SPEC_ALIGN: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/CRITIQUE: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/VALIDATE: CHECK
plan-validation-cycle/APPROVE: DONE
```

---

## Impact

Low - This is a design document that will be implemented in CH-003. The correction should happen during DO phase of WORK-040.
