# Observation: TRD-WORK-ITEM-UNIVERSAL vs GovernanceLayer current_node Mismatch

## What Was Observed

The TRD-WORK-ITEM-UNIVERSAL (docs/specs/TRD-WORK-ITEM-UNIVERSAL.md:110) defines `current_node` with values:
```
backlog | planning | in_progress | review | complete
```

GovernanceLayer.VALID_TRANSITIONS (.claude/haios/modules/governance_layer.py:61-68) uses:
```
backlog | discovery | plan | implement | close | complete
```

These are completely different vocabularies. The TRD was "approved Session 218" but the implementation uses different values.

## Impact

- WORK-065 found 94% of work items stuck at `current_node: backlog` regardless of status
- Transitions are never called because cycle skills don't use the TRD values
- The field provides no value in its current state

## Suggested Action

- Merge with CH-006 (Node Transitions Investigation) and WORK-016
- Decide: align TRD to GovernanceLayer, or remove current_node entirely
