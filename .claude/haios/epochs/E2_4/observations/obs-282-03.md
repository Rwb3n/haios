# Observation: 3 Skills Defined But Never Invoked

**Finding:** Three skills exist in .claude/skills/ but grep found 0 invocations anywhere in codebase:
- audit (SKILL.md exists, no `skill="audit"` calls)
- schema-ref (SKILL.md exists, no `skill="schema-ref"` calls)
- extract-content (SKILL.md exists, no `skill="extract-content"` calls)

**Implication:** These are either:
1. Aspirational skills (designed but not yet integrated into workflows)
2. Dead code (skills created but workflows changed)
3. Documentation-only (reference material not meant to be invoked)

**Potential Action:** Either integrate these skills into appropriate workflows (e.g., audit in coldstart, schema-ref in schema-verifier), or mark them explicitly as "reference only" / "planned" in their SKILL.md files.
