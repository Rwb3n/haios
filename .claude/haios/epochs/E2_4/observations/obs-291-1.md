# Observation: dod-validation-cycle CHECK phase should be haiku subagent

## What Was Observed

During WORK-080 closure, the dod-validation-cycle CHECK phase was executed inline by the main agent. This phase is mechanical work:
- Finding associated plan files (Glob)
- Checking memory_refs field population (Grep)
- Reading plan status (Read)

## Why It Matters

1. **Context consumption:** CHECK phase consumes main agent context for mechanical tasks
2. **Model mismatch:** Per WORK-068, haiku is appropriate for "mechanical/fast tasks"
3. **Pattern exists:** preflight-checker, schema-verifier, test-runner already use this pattern
4. **Consistency:** Other validation cycles should follow same delegation pattern

## Recommended Action

Refactor dod-validation-cycle to invoke a haiku subagent for CHECK phase:

```python
Task(subagent_type='dod-checker', model='haiku', prompt='Check DoD prerequisites for {work_id}')
```

The subagent would return structured JSON with:
- plans_found: list of plan paths
- plans_status: dict of path -> status
- memory_refs_populated: bool
- prerequisites_met: bool
