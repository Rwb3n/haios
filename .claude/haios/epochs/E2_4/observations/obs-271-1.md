# Observation: Activities Arc ARC.md Shows Chapters as Planned but Complete

## What Was Observed

The ARC.md for the activities arc (`.claude/haios/epochs/E2_4/arcs/activities/ARC.md`) shows CH-001 through CH-004 all as "Planned" in the table (lines 29-33), but per WORK-042 closure message, all chapters are complete and the arc is complete.

## Evidence

File: `.claude/haios/epochs/E2_4/arcs/activities/ARC.md:29-33`

```markdown
| Chapter | Name | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| CH-001 | ActivityMatrix | Planned | Define full matrix of primitives × states × rules |
| CH-002 | StateDefinitions | Planned | Formalize EXPLORE, DESIGN, PLAN, DO, CHECK, DONE states |
| CH-003 | GovernanceRules | Planned | Implement rules per governed activity |
| CH-004 | PreToolUseIntegration | Planned | Wire governed activities to PreToolUse hook |
```

All should be "Complete".

## Implication

Status drift between work items and parent arc documentation. Next session may waste cycles on already-complete work.

## Suggested Action

Update ARC.md chapter statuses to Complete.
