## What

"Can you drop .claude/haios/ into a fresh workspace with a corpus of docs and have it produce a working product?" - Current answer is NO.

## Why It Matters

This is the actual success criterion. Everything else (epochs, arcs, cycles) is implementation detail. If portability test fails, system doesn't work.

## Evidence

ContextLoader hardcoded to HAIOS paths. No Requirement Extractor. No Planner Agent. No Validator Agent.
