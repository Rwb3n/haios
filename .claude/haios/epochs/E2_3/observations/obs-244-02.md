# Observation: Chapter File Not Updated on Work Closure

## What Was Observed

When WORK-015 was closed (completing CH-002 success criteria), the chapter file `.claude/haios/epochs/E2_3/arcs/pipeline/CH-002-requirement-extractor.md` still shows `Status: Active`.

## Evidence

From CH-002-requirement-extractor.md:
```markdown
| Chapter | Name | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| CH-002 | RequirementExtractor | Active | ... |
```

All success criteria for CH-002 are met by WORK-015, but chapter status not updated.

## Impact

Chapter status diverges from actual completion state. Future sessions may think CH-002 work remains.

## Potential Fix

Add step to close-work-cycle (or observation-triage-cycle):
1. Read work item `chapter` field
2. If chapter exists, check if all work items for that chapter are complete
3. If yes, update chapter status to Complete

Alternatively: Manual chapter update as part of arc-level review.

## Priority

Low - chapter status is informational, work item status is authoritative.
