# Observation: Deprecated .claude/lib/ Still Has Consumers

## Context

During E2-236 implementation, discovered that `tests/test_governance_events.py` imports from `.claude/lib/governance_events.py` despite `.claude/lib/README.md` (lines 5-8) marking the directory as DEPRECATED since Session 221 (WORK-006).

## Impact

When running multiple test files together, the deprecated path pollutes sys.path and causes import confusion. Tests pass individually but fail when run alongside other tests that import from the canonical `.claude/haios/lib/` path.

## Evidence

```
# .claude/lib/README.md lines 5-8:
> **DEPRECATED (Session 221, WORK-006):** This location is deprecated.
> All modules have been migrated to `.claude/haios/lib/` for portability.

# But test_governance_events.py still uses it
```

## Suggested Action

Update `test_governance_events.py` to import from `.claude/haios/lib/` or remove the deprecated `.claude/lib/` directory entirely.
