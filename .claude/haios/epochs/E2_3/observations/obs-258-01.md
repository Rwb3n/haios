# Observation: 18 Pre-existing Test Failures

## Summary

Full test suite shows 18 failures unrelated to WORK-031. These represent accumulated drift that should be triaged.

## Evidence

```
pytest tests/ -v
# 871 passed, 18 failed
```

Failing tests:
- test_checkpoint_cycle_verify.py (6 tests)
- test_coldstart_orchestrator.py (1 test)
- test_hooks.py (4 tests)
- test_lib_migration.py (1 test)
- test_lib_scaffold.py (1 test)
- test_observation_capture_cycle.py (1 test)
- test_routing_gate.py (2 tests)
- test_survey_cycle.py (1 test)
- test_template_rfc2119.py (1 test)

## Impact

- Tests pass locally for new work (WORK-031: 25/25)
- But accumulated failures mask new regressions
- CI would fail if enabled

## Potential Actions

1. **Investigation:** Categorize failures by root cause
2. **Bugfix:** Fix the failing tests
3. **Cleanup:** Remove obsolete tests for removed features
