## What

Universal work item structure designed before pipeline stages exist. Fields chosen based on speculation, not actual stage requirements.

## Why It Matters

The structure may not serve the actual consumers (INGEST, PLAN, BUILD, VALIDATE agents). We're building interfaces for systems that don't exist yet.

## Evidence

TRD acceptance_criteria field - duplicated in frontmatter and body, no clear source of truth.
