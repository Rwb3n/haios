# obs-256-01: Queue filter uses status field while lifecycle tracks via current_node

## Observation

WorkEngine.get_queue() filters work items by `status` field, but the work item lifecycle is tracked via `current_node` field. This creates a mismatch:

- E2-293 and E2-294 both had `current_node: complete` but `status: active`
- Both appeared in the queue as actionable work items
- Fixed manually by updating status to match node

## Root Cause

The close-work recipe (`just close-work`) updates `current_node` but the `status` field synchronization may be incomplete, or these items were closed before proper sync was implemented.

## Impact

Operators select "ready" work that is actually already complete. Wastes cognitive load and causes confusion.

## Suggested Action

Either:
1. WorkEngine.get_queue() should filter by `current_node` instead of/in addition to `status`
2. close-work-cycle should ensure `status` is always synchronized with `current_node`
3. Add validation that catches this drift (status != expected for node)
