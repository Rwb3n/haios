# Observation: Triage Cycle Scans Wrong Location for Observations

## What Was Observed

`just triage-observations` returned 0 items despite 13 pending observations existing.

## Evidence

```
> just triage-observations
Found 0 archived items with untriaged observations:
No untriaged observations found.
```

But:
```
> grep -l "triage_status: pending" .claude/haios/epochs/E2_3/observations/*.md
13 files found
```

## Root Cause

`scan_archived_observations()` in observations.py scans `docs/work/archive/*/observations.md` (archived work item observations).

But epoch-level observations live in `.claude/haios/epochs/E2_3/observations/obs-*.md`.

The observation-triage-cycle skill says "Find archived work items with untriaged observations" - this is the wrong location for the three-phase observation flow defined in the observations arc.

## Impact

- Triage cycle is broken for epoch observations
- Agent must manually grep to find pending observations
- The defined three-phase flow (CAPTURE → PROMOTE → TRIAGE) doesn't work

## Suggested Fix

Update observations.py `scan_archived_observations()` to also scan epoch observation directory:
- Read `epoch.observations_dir` from haios.yaml
- Include `obs-*.md` files with `triage_status: pending`

Or create separate function `scan_epoch_observations()`.
