# Observation: plan-validation-cycle Checkpoint Gate Ignores Session Freshness

## What Was Observed

plan-validation-cycle APPROVE phase has a MUST gate:
> "MUST invoke checkpoint-cycle (E2-287)"

This gate fired after coldstart in Session 214, creating a checkpoint nearly identical to Session 213's checkpoint. The new checkpoint added no meaningful context - same memory_refs, same pending work, only difference was "Plan validation passed."

## Why This Is Wrong

The checkpoint gate assumes plan authoring + validation happen in ONE session:
```
Session N: author plan → validate plan → checkpoint (lots of context) → DO
```

But the actual flow was:
```
Session 213: author plan → checkpoint (correct)
Session 214: coldstart (fresh) → validate plan → checkpoint (wasteful) → DO
```

After coldstart, context is minimal. Checkpointing after validation adds no value because:
1. The plan file already has `status: approved` (source of truth)
2. No new learnings or decisions were captured
3. memory_refs were already in Session 213's checkpoint

## Root Cause

The MUST gate is unconditional. It doesn't consider:
- Whether the session started fresh from coldstart
- Whether meaningful context has accumulated since last checkpoint
- Whether the new checkpoint would contain novel information

## Proposed Fix

Change plan-validation-cycle APPROVE phase from:
```
MUST checkpoint
```

To:
```
SHOULD checkpoint IF:
- Significant context accumulated since coldstart/last checkpoint
- OR plan authoring happened this session

MAY skip checkpoint IF:
- Session is fresh from coldstart
- AND plan was authored in a prior session
- AND validation added no new learnings
```

## Impact

- Wasted tokens on redundant checkpoint creation
- Noisy checkpoint history (two nearly-identical checkpoints)
- Cognitive overhead for operator reviewing checkpoints
