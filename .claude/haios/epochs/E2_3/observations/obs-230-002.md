# Observation: WORK.md Deliverable Checkbox Automation Missing

## What Was Observed

During CH-005 closure, the WORK.md deliverables section had all checkboxes unchecked:
```markdown
- [ ] **R1: session.yaml config** - ...
- [ ] **R2: SessionLoader class** - ...
...
```

Despite all deliverable artifacts being present and verified:
- session.yaml existed (1272 bytes)
- session_loader.py existed (7039 bytes)
- 5/5 tests passed
- just session-context recipe worked
- coldstart.md wiring complete

The CHECK phase manually verified each deliverable and updated checkboxes, but this was agent work that could potentially be automated.

## Expected Behavior

When deliverable artifacts exist and can be machine-verified (file exists, grep patterns match), checkboxes could auto-update or at least surface "artifact exists but unchecked" warnings.

## Impact

- Agent may prematurely declare victory without checking all deliverables
- CHECK phase becomes tedious manual verification
- Risk of false negatives (closing with unchecked work)

## Suggested Action

Low priority. The manual verification step forces thoroughness. But could be a future "deliverable verification" utility that checks artifact existence against deliverable patterns.
