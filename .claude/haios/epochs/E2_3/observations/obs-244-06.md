# Observation: Meta-Observations Have No Defined Home

## What Was Observed

After completing observation triage, the agent had observations about the triage process itself. The question arose: "Where do observations about observations go?"

## The Recursion

```
Observation triage surfaces gaps
    → Gaps become observations
    → Observations go to epoch obs dir
    → Next triage processes them
    → Triage surfaces gaps about triage
    → Gaps become observations
    → ...
```

## Resolution

Determined that **epoch observations** is the correct location because:
1. Triage is not a work item (no work item observations.md)
2. Triage is not an investigation (no investigation to attach to)
3. It's an ad-hoc process execution that surfaced insights
4. Ad-hoc insights → epoch observations

## Insight

The observation system is intentionally recursive. Observations about the observation system feed back into the same pool. This is correct behavior, not a bug.

The system eats its own tail - meta-observations improve the observation system itself over time.

## Documentation Gap

This resolution should be documented in:
- observation-triage-cycle SKILL.md (add "meta-observations go to epoch obs")
- observations arc ARC.md (add recursion as feature)
