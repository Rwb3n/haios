# Observation: L4 Feedback Loop Incomplete

## What Was Noticed

The requirements traceability loop from L4 -> Epoch -> Arc -> Chapter -> Work -> Close -> Memory is incomplete. When work items complete:
- Observations are captured
- Memory refs are stored
- BUT there's no formal mechanism to promote architectural learnings back to L4

## Evidence

Session 233 L4 consolidation was operator-directed, not system-triggered. The system doesn't detect when:
- A completed work item changes module interfaces (should update L4/functional_requirements.md)
- An observation is architectural (should trigger L4 review)

## Potential Actions

1. **investigation** - Design L4 promotion paths in observation-triage-cycle
2. **skill-update** - Add L4 promotion step to close-work-cycle for module work
3. **adr** - Document L4 maintenance policy

## Memory Refs

- 82343, 82344, 82345, 82346 (Session 233 learnings)
