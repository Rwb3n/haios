# Observation: Status Hook Needs Redesign for E2.3

## Summary

UserPromptSubmit hook still reads deprecated milestone data, causing stale status messages. Quick fix applied (disable), but proper redesign needed.

## Evidence

Before fix:
```
APPROACHING: M7b-WorkInfra at 91% - 5 items to completion
```

Code location:
- `user_prompt_submit.py` lines 95-99: thresholds (now disabled)
- `user_prompt_submit.py` lines 79-87: vitals (disabled Session 179)
- `ContextLoader.generate_status()`: still produces milestone data

Milestones in status:
```python
['M8-Memory', 'Epoch3-FORESIGHT', 'M7e-Hygiene', 'M7b-WorkInfra', 'M7c-Governance']
```

## Impact

- Stale status messages confuse context
- Milestones were E2.0/2.1 concept, replaced by Arcs/Chapters in E2.3
- Status generation wastes cycles computing unused data

## Quick Fix Applied

Session 259: Disabled `_get_thresholds()` alongside already-disabled vitals.

## Proper Fix Needed

1. Remove milestone generation from ContextLoader
2. Redesign status for Arc/Chapter progress tracking
3. Update thresholds to use new structure (or remove entirely)

## Potential Actions

1. **Cleanup:** Remove milestone code from status generation
2. **Investigation:** Design new progress tracking for Arc/Chapter model
