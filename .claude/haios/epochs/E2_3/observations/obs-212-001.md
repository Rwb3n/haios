# Observation: Disabled Code in user_prompt_submit.py

## What Was Observed

`.claude/hooks/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py` has accumulated disabled code:
- Lines 71-76: `_check_context_threshold()` disabled Session 179 ("Context estimate is unreliable")
- Lines 79-87: Vitals injection disabled Session 179 ("Vitals structure outdated after E2.2 chapter redesign")

## Context

Discovered during E2-235 investigation. The disabled code represents two features that were turned off but not removed:
1. Context threshold checking (now superseded by statusLine)
2. Vitals injection (outdated after milestone→chapter migration)

## Potential Actions

- **bugfix**: Remove disabled code blocks entirely (dead code cleanup)
- **investigation**: Evaluate if vitals injection should be re-enabled with updated structure

- E2-235 observations
