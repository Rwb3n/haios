# Observation: WORK.md Node Transitions Not Tracked

## What Was Observed

During CH-005 closure, the WORK.md file showed `current_node: backlog` despite the work item having completed the full DO phase (session.yaml, session_loader.py, 5 tests, recipe, coldstart wiring).

The `node_history` only contained one entry:
```yaml
node_history:
- node: backlog
  entered: 2026-01-24 18:24:50
  exited: null
```

No transitions to `in_progress` or `complete` were recorded.

## Expected Behavior

Node transitions should track through the work lifecycle:
- backlog -> in_progress (when DO phase starts)
- in_progress -> complete (when DONE phase completes)

## Potential Root Cause

The implementation-cycle and close-work-cycle may not be updating `current_node` and `node_history` during phase transitions.

## Suggested Investigation

1. Check if `just set-cycle` updates node_history
2. Check if close-work recipe updates current_node
3. Determine if node transitions are governance-gated or manual
