# Observation: CLAUDE.md Bloat and Recipe Discoverability Gap

## What Was Observed

After implementing E2-179 (--spawned-by for scaffold recipes), the new capability is not discoverable to agents. It's documented in `.claude/lib/README.md` but:

1. README.md is not in the bootstrap path
2. CLAUDE.md (which IS in bootstrap) is already 209 lines of bloat
3. Adding more tables to CLAUDE.md doesn't help - it's reference docs masquerading as bootstrap context

## The Deeper Problem

CLAUDE.md tries to be both:
- **Reference documentation** (all the tables, rules, paths)
- **Bootstrap context** (what agent needs to start working)

An agent starting fresh doesn't need 209 lines. They need:
1. Identity (who am I)
2. Active context (epoch, arc)
3. Spellbook (what can I cast)
4. Guardrails (hard constraints)

Everything else should be **loaded on demand** via coldstart, skills, or memory queries.

## Operator Insight

> "An agent should roleplay like this is a game and just recipes are their spells. Spells they have mastered."

The spellbook metaphor: agents need to KNOW their capabilities, not read a manual every session. Current CLAUDE.md is a manual, not mastery.

## Potential Actions

- **investigation**: Design proper bootstrap vs reference separation
- **adr**: Architecture decision on context loading strategy
- **skill-update**: Create `/spellbook` command that surfaces agent capabilities

## Impact

- New features like E2-179 are implemented but not discoverable
- Agent context budget wasted on reference material
- Bootstrap friction increases with every CLAUDE.md addition

## References

- E2-179 implementation (trigger for this observation)
- CLAUDE.md (the bloated file)
- Coldstart skill (current bootstrap mechanism)
