# Observation: Mandatory Checkpoint Chaining (E2-287)

## Context

Work complexity within the hardened gating system is causing context limits to be hit per work item. Context exhaustion mid-work loses reasoning and decisions.

## Observation

Checkpoints were only created manually or at session end. No automatic checkpointing at critical transition points.

## Resolution

Modified three skills to MUST chain `checkpoint-cycle`:

1. **plan-authoring-cycle** - After VALIDATE phase, before chaining to plan-validation-cycle
2. **plan-validation-cycle** - After APPROVE phase (on success), before returning to implementation-cycle
3. **close-work-cycle** - In CHAIN phase, before routing to next work

## Rationale

| Checkpoint Point | Why Here |
|-----------------|----------|
| After plan authoring | Plan represents significant decisions; context may exhaust during validation/implementation |
| After plan validation | Plan validated = safe to checkpoint; implementation may exhaust context |
| After work closure | Completed work context must be preserved before new work starts |

## Impact

- More frequent checkpoints = better continuity
- Context preserved at transition points
- Next session can pick up with full context of decisions made
