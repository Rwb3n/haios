# Observation: VERSION Hardcoding in Tests is Fragile

## Summary

`tests/test_requirement_extractor.py` line 166 had hardcoded `VERSION == "1.0.0"` assertion. When bumping version to 1.1.0 for CorpusLoader integration (WORK-031), test failed.

## Evidence

```python
# test_requirement_extractor.py:166
assert result.extractor_version == "1.0.0"  # FRAGILE
```

## Impact

- Version bumps require test updates
- Easy to forget, causes false failures
- Coupling between source and test is unnecessary

## Recommended Fix

Test VERSION format rather than exact value:

```python
# Instead of exact match:
assert result.extractor_version == "1.0.0"

# Use format validation:
import re
assert re.match(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', result.extractor_version)
```

Or use the source constant:

```python
from requirement_extractor import RequirementExtractor
assert result.extractor_version == RequirementExtractor.VERSION
```
