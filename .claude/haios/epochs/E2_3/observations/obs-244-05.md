# Observation: Spawned Work Items Missing traces_to Field

## What Was Observed

All 7 work items spawned during triage have empty `traces_to: []` fields despite REQ-TRACE-002 requiring work items to trace to L4 requirements.

## Evidence

```yaml
# WORK-016 through WORK-022 all have:
traces_to: []  # REQUIRED: L4 requirement IDs
```

## Impact

- Work items exist without L4 traceability
- REQ-TRACE-002 violated (work creation should validate traces_to)
- Can't verify work aligns with L4 requirements

## Why It Happened

Triage flow focuses on:
1. Category (bug/gap/debt/insight)
2. Action (spawn:INV/spawn:WORK/spawn:FIX)
3. Chapter/Arc assignment

But doesn't include:
4. L4 requirement lookup

The observations themselves don't reference L4 requirements, so there's no obvious mapping.

## Questions

1. Should observations include `traces_to` hints?
2. Should triage flow require L4 lookup before spawning?
3. Or is traces_to a work-creation-cycle responsibility (populated when work item enters READY)?

## Suggested Investigation

Design the traces_to population flow. Where in the observation → work item pipeline should L4 traceability be established?
