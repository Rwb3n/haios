# obs-222-001: Discoverability Patterns Missing

## Observation

No `just help` or equivalent discoverability pattern exists. User must know recipe names to use them.

Related gaps:
- No `just list` to show available recipes by category
- No `--help` flag on individual recipes
- No discoverable index of slash commands
- No `haios.yaml` discoverability section pointing to capabilities

## Context

Session 222: After completing WORK-005, operator noted discoverability friction. The Loader base enables config-driven extraction, but users need to discover what configs exist.

## Potential Actions

1. Add `just help` recipe (categorized recipe listing)
2. Add discoverability section to haios.yaml
3. Create `/help` command that lists available commands/skills
4. Document in L4/technical_requirements.md as agent UX requirement
