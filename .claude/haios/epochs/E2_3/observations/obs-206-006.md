## What

L4 is not a monolithic file. It decomposes into:
- project_requirements (WHAT we're building)
- agent_user_requirements (WHAT users/agents can DO with it)
- technical_requirements (HOW to enable those capabilities)

## Why It Matters

Different roles load different requirements. Main Agent loads L0-L3. Project Foreman loads L4/*. Builder loads technical_requirements. This enables separation of concerns through selective context loading.

## Evidence

Operator sketched the decomposition. Derivation chain: project → agent/user → technical. Each layer derived from the one above.
