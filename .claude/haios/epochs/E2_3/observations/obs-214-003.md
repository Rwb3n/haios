# Observation: Work Items Lack Epoch Field - Causes Legacy Drift

## What Was Observed

Session 214 loaded E2.3 context (epoch, arcs) but spent entire session implementing E2-179 (legacy E2 work). No gate caught this drift.

**The flow:**
```
Coldstart loads E2.3 context
    ↓
Survey-cycle queries queue
    ↓
Queue returns E2-179 (legacy)
    ↓
Agent implements legacy work
    ↓
E2.3 arcs untouched
```

## Root Cause

Work items have no `epoch:` field. The system cannot distinguish:
- Legacy cleanup (E2 work during E2.3)
- Arc-aligned progress (E2.3 work during E2.3)

`just queue` and `just ready` return all unblocked work regardless of epoch alignment.

## Proposed Fix

1. **Add to work_item.md template:**
```yaml
epoch: {{EPOCH}}  # Auto-populated from haios.yaml active epoch
arc: null         # Optional - links to specific arc if applicable
```

2. **Update scaffold.py:**
   - Read `epoch.epoch_id` from haios.yaml
   - Inject as EPOCH variable during scaffold

3. **Update survey-cycle:**
   - Filter/sort by epoch alignment
   - WARN if selecting epoch-misaligned work
   - Require operator approval for cross-epoch work

## Impact

- Agent spent session on legacy work instead of epoch goals
- E2.3 arcs have zero progress after 6 days
- No observability into epoch drift

## Alignment

This fits WorkUniversal arc (already active). The universal work item schema should include epoch traceability.
