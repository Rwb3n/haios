## What

Discovered repeatable pattern to recover context after /compact, crash, or context loss by reading the session transcript JSONL file.

## Why It Matters

Context loss is inevitable (compaction, crashes, long sessions). Having a codified recovery pattern prevents re-discovery each time. Currently ad-hoc - should be automated.

## Evidence

Session 208 - successfully recovered synthesis discussion by:
1. Reading transcript path from compaction summary
2. Tailing transcript JSONL
3. Grepping for topic keywords
4. Parsing JSONL for user/assistant messages
5. Re-reading source files mentioned

## Potential Resolution

Create `context-recovery` subagent or skill that:
1. Detects context loss signals (compaction message, crash resume, session continuation summary)
2. Automatically reads transcript
3. Extracts recent discussion topics
4. Restores relevant context
