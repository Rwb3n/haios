## What

CLAUDE.md has grown bloated again despite previous sessions discussing keeping it as a thin wrapper. It's not un-useful, but it's trying to do too much simultaneously.

## Why It Matters

CLAUDE.md is loaded on EVERY prompt. Bloat = token waste + cognitive overload. Should be minimal pointer to skills/agents that load on-demand, not a comprehensive reference.

## Evidence

- Session 208 operator observation
- Pattern recurs - we've trimmed it before, it grows back
- Current state: governance tables, memory tools, agent lists, constraints all inline

## Potential Resolution

Create a subagent with skill for context-loading. CLAUDE.md becomes thin bootstrap:
1. Identity (who am I)
2. Entry point (invoke /coldstart or skill)
3. Critical invariants only (MUST rules)

Everything else loads via skill/subagent on demand.
