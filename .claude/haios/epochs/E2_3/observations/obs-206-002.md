## What

Decisions exist in memory (e.g., 81358: "Type is a field, not prefix") but rationale is not captured. We have WHAT was decided, not WHY.

## Why It Matters

Future sessions re-discover the same questions. Without WHY, decisions can't be evaluated for continued relevance. Design review becomes impossible.

## Evidence

S190 decisions (81357-81365) are all statements without reasoning. TRD-WORK-ITEM-UNIVERSAL has no grounded rationale for key choices.
