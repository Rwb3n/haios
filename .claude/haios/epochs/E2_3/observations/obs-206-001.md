## What

Agent falls into tactical/build mode even during strategic discussions. Operator says "proceed" meaning "proceed with defining", agent hears "proceed with implementing".

## Why It Matters

Strategic work requires pause and approval gates. Without explicit mode, agent defaults to building. This produces artifacts that may not be approved.

## Evidence

This session - drafted TRD, created WORK-001, asked "want WORK-002?" without design approval.
