# Observation: current_node Stuck at Backlog

## What Was Observed

WORK-015 completed full implementation cycle and closure, but `current_node: backlog` in WORK.md never updated. The `node_history` shows only the initial backlog entry with no subsequent transitions.

## Evidence

```yaml
current_node: backlog
node_history:
- node: backlog
  entered: 2026-01-25 22:35:52
  exited: null
```

## Impact

Cosmetic - the `status: complete` field is authoritative per ADR-041. However, `current_node` and `node_history` exist to track work item lifecycle and are currently not being updated.

## Potential Fix

Either:
1. Implementation-cycle/close-work-cycle should call `WorkEngine.transition_node()` at phase boundaries
2. OR remove `current_node`/`node_history` fields if not used (YAGNI)

## Priority

Low - does not affect functionality, only metadata accuracy.
