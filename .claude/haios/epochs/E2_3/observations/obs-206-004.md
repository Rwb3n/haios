## What

206 sessions without a clear statement of what HAIOS actually produces. "Governance Suite" is a means, not an end.

## Why It Matters

Without mission, every session is discovery. No way to measure progress toward goal. PM infrastructure tracked itself.

## Evidence

Session 206 articulated for first time: "Ingest corpus → transform → functional product"
