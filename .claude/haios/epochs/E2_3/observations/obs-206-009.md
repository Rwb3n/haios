## What

Observation lifecycle is three phases, not two:

```
CAPTURE → PROMOTE → TRIAGE
```

- CAPTURE: At work close, 3 questions, raw notes to work dir
- PROMOTE: Filter noise, create atomic obs files at epoch level, store to memory with provenance
- TRIAGE: Route epoch-level obs to actionable outcomes (spawn work, dismiss)

## Why It Matters

Current system compressed PROMOTE into TRIAGE. That's why triage has `memory` as an action - it's doing promotion inline. Separating them keeps each phase single-responsibility.

## Evidence

- observation-capture-cycle outputs to work dir
- observation-triage-cycle has `memory` action (that's promotion, not triage)
- No mechanism creates atomic obs-{session}-{seq}.md files
