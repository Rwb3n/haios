# obs-250-02: mcp_server.py import chain broken - cannot store to memory via Python

## Observation

`mcp_server.py` cannot be imported because its dependency chain is broken:
```
mcp_server.py -> extraction.py -> preprocessors (ModuleNotFoundError)
```

The `preprocessors` module does not exist in `.claude/haios/lib/`. This prevents:
- Storing closure summaries to memory via Python
- Any direct Python invocation of memory ingestion
- The why-capturer agent from functioning

MCP tools via Claude Code still work (they bypass Python import), but programmatic access is broken.

## Impact

Memory storage during close-work-cycle MEMORY phase fails silently. Observations and learnings captured in files but not stored to semantic memory database.

## Suggested Action

Either add `preprocessors.py` to `.claude/haios/lib/` or make the import conditional/lazy in `extraction.py`.
