## What

Current HAIOS is the Builder Agent's toolkit. Coldstart loads everything (L0-L4). Cycles are builder workflows (PLAN→DO→CHECK→DONE). Skills are builder operations. System prompt says "Hephaestus (Builder)".

## Why It Matters

We've built one role's context and called it the whole system. Missing: Project Foreman, Validator Agent, role-based context loading.

## Evidence

- Coldstart loads L0-L4 (everything, not role-specific)
- implementation-cycle, investigation-cycle are execution workflows
- scaffold, validate, close-work are builder operations
- No agent decomposition work exists
