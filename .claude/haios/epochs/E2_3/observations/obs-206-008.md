# Observation: Work Items Belong in Epochs, Not docs/

## What

Work items should live in `.claude/haios/epochs/E2_3/work/`, not `docs/work/`. No active/archive split - status is metadata in WORK.md, not directory location.

## Why It Matters

Portability test: "Drop `.claude/haios/` into a fresh workspace." If work items are in `docs/work/`, they pollute the project and come along when plugin is copied. Work items are system ops, not project artifacts.

Also: moving files breaks memory references. ADR-041 already said "status over location" but we didn't apply it to top-level structure.

## Evidence

- Memory refs point to file paths
- Moving to archive/ breaks references
- Current `docs/work/active/` and `docs/work/archive/` is the wrong pattern
- Query by `status: complete` in frontmatter, not by directory

## Target Structure

```
.claude/haios/epochs/E2_3/work/
├── WORK-001/
│   └── WORK.md    # status: active|complete
├── WORK-002/
│   └── WORK.md
```
