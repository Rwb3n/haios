## What

Synthesis pipeline Stage 5 (PRUNE) exists in design but not in practice. `mark_as_synthesized()` tags metadata but:
- No actual archiving
- No retrieval exclusion
- No soft-delete mechanism

## Current State

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Synthesized insights | 15,895 |
| Source concepts (marked) | 19,693 |
| Raw concepts (untouched) | 46,359 |
| **Total** | 81,947 |

## Why It Matters for E3

82k concepts is a large haystack. If 19k are "already synthesized into higher-order insights", they could be:
1. Excluded from semantic search (retrieval optimization)
2. Archived to cold storage (space optimization)
3. Used only for provenance lookup (query pattern change)

## Potential E3 Work

- Implement archive table with soft-delete
- Add `archived_at` column to concepts
- Modify retrieval to exclude archived by default
- Add `--include-archived` flag for provenance queries
- Usage tracking: which concepts actually get retrieved and used?
