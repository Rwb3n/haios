# Epoch 3: Memory & Autonomy

status: future
predecessor: E2.3
theme: "The Memory Palace"

---

## Vision

Epoch 3 focuses on memory optimization and autonomous operation. The Chariot (E2) built the governance infrastructure. E3 refines the memory system to support truly autonomous sessions.

## Key Areas

### Memory Optimization
- Stage 5 PRUNE implementation
- Usage tracking (what gets retrieved?)
- Quality metrics (which syntheses help?)
- Archive strategy for low-value concepts
- Retrieval exclusion for synthesized sources

### Autonomous Operation
- Session loop without operator
- Self-directed work selection
- Confidence-based escalation
- Error recovery patterns

### FORESIGHT Layer (from E2-106)
- SIMULATE: Predict outcomes before action
- INTROSPECT: Assess own capabilities
- ANTICIPATE: Flag likely failure modes
- UPDATE: Calibrate from results

## Observations

Observations captured during E2.x that relate to E3 themes live in `observations/`.

## Entry Criteria

- E2.3 Pipeline arc complete
- Chariot modules integrated and tested
- Work infrastructure stable
- Memory system functional (even if chonky)
