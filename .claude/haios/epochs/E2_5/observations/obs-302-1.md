# Observation: CYCLE_PHASES Investigation Order Drift

## Summary

The `CYCLE_PHASES["investigation-cycle"]` in `cycle_runner.py:135` defines phases as `["HYPOTHESIZE", "EXPLORE", "CONCLUDE", "CHAIN"]`, but L4 REQ-FLOW-002 in `functional_requirements.md` defines the Investigation lifecycle as `EXPLORE → HYPOTHESIZE → VALIDATE → CONCLUDE`.

## Drift Details

| Source | Phase Order |
|--------|-------------|
| cycle_runner.py:135 | HYPOTHESIZE, EXPLORE, CONCLUDE, CHAIN |
| L4 REQ-FLOW-002 | EXPLORE, HYPOTHESIZE, VALIDATE, CONCLUDE |

**Differences:**
1. Order differs: Code has HYPOTHESIZE first, L4 has EXPLORE first
2. VALIDATE phase missing from code
3. CHAIN is in code but not in L4 (CHAIN is a meta-phase for skill chaining)

## Impact

Low - PAUSE_PHASES uses L4-authoritative phase names (CONCLUDE), so pause semantics work correctly. However, any future work relying on CYCLE_PHASES for investigation phase order may be incorrect.

## Recommended Action

Align CYCLE_PHASES with L4 REQ-FLOW-002 in a future work item.
