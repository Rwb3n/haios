# Observation: observation-triage-cycle vs L4 Triage Lifecycle Drift

## Summary

The `CYCLE_PHASES["observation-triage-cycle"]` in `cycle_runner.py:140` defines phases as `["SCAN", "TRIAGE", "PROMOTE"]`, but L4 defines the Triage lifecycle as `SCAN → ASSESS → RANK → COMMIT`.

## Drift Details

| Source | Phase Names |
|--------|-------------|
| cycle_runner.py:140 | SCAN, TRIAGE, PROMOTE |
| L4 Triage lifecycle | SCAN, ASSESS, RANK, COMMIT |

**Differences:**
1. Different phase names after SCAN
2. Code has 3 phases, L4 has 4 phases
3. Terminal phase: Code has PROMOTE, L4 has COMMIT

## Impact

Medium - PAUSE_PHASES uses L4-authoritative phase name `COMMIT` for triage lifecycle pause point. If observation-triage-cycle reaches terminal phase `PROMOTE`, the `is_at_pause_point()` check will return False because PROMOTE != COMMIT.

## Recommended Action

Either:
1. Rename observation-triage-cycle terminal phase from PROMOTE to COMMIT, OR
2. Add PROMOTE to PAUSE_PHASES["triage"] as an alias
