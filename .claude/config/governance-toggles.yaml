# Governance Toggle Configuration
#
# Controls feature flags for PreToolUse governance checks.
# Edit this file to enable/disable specific checks.
#
# Usage:
#   - Set to true to BLOCK the behavior
#   - Set to false to ALLOW the behavior
#
# Why toggles exist:
#   - Some governance rules need temporary bypass
#   - Allows operator control without code changes

# PowerShell Blocking (added Session 133)
# Blocks: powershell, powershell.exe, pwsh commands through Bash tool
# Reason: PowerShell through bash mangles $_ and $variable references
# Mitigation: Use just recipes, Glob/Grep/Read tools, or Python scripts
block_powershell: true

# SQL Blocking (E2-020)
# Blocks: Direct SQL queries without schema-verifier subagent
# Note: This is hardcoded in pre_tool_use.py, not yet configurable
# block_sql: true  # Future: migrate to toggle
