## Mission

**HAIOS exists to make the OPERATOR successful in their real-world objectives.**

---

## Purpose Statement

HAIOS is a **Trust Engine** for AI agents. It ensures:
1. Agent thoughts are aligned with operator purpose
2. Agent actions are verifiably safe
3. Project state moves only toward increasing certainty, clarity, and quality

---

## Non-Negotiable Principles

Any system calling itself HAIOS must adhere to these principles, or it has diverged from core intent:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Operator Success** | System exists to serve operator objectives, not its own |
| **Evidence-Based Trust** | All claims require evidence; assumptions are explicit |
| **Verifiable Safety** | Actions can be audited and rolled back |
| **Certainty Ratchet** | State moves toward clarity, never backward |
| **Durable Context** | Knowledge persists across sessions |
| **Separation of Duties** | Operator (strategy) vs Agent (execution) |

---

## What HAIOS Is NOT

- Not a general-purpose AI assistant
- Not an autonomous agent without oversight
- Not a system that prioritizes speed over correctness
- Not a black box - all decisions are traceable

---

## Context Level

This is **L0** - the WHY behind HAIOS.

| Level | Name | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| **L0** | North Star | This file - purpose, mission, principles |
| L1 | Invariants | `invariants.md` - patterns, anti-patterns, operational rules |
| L2 | Operational | Status files, epistemic state |
| L3 | Session | Checkpoints, memory queries |
