the Edit tool is having issues with file watchers.... 
resulting in: Thinking…

  The file looks exactly the same. The system keeps saying it's modified. This might be a timestamp issue or file watcher. Let me try using the 
  Write tool instead to create a new version with the ToC included. First, let me read the entire file.
  
  which forces context window bloating.

   Let me think about what happened:
  1. I read the file
  2. I grepped for sections
  3. I tried to edit
  4. Got errors
  5. Kept trying different approaches (re-reading, Write tool, etc.)
  6. Wasted a lot of context on failed attempts
