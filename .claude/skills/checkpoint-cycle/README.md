# Checkpoint Cycle Skill

HAIOS Checkpoint Cycle for structured session capture with anti-pattern verification and guaranteed git commit.

## Usage

```
Skill(skill="checkpoint-cycle")
```

## Phases

SCAFFOLD → FILL → VERIFY → CAPTURE → COMMIT

The VERIFY phase invokes the anti-pattern-checker agent to validate completion claims before storing learnings to memory.

See `SKILL.md` for detailed phase definitions.
