# Close Work Cycle

This skill defines the VALIDATE-ARCHIVE-MEMORY cycle for closing work items with Definition of Done (DoD) enforcement per ADR-033.

## When to Use

**Invoked automatically** by `/close` command after observation-capture-cycle.
**Manual invocation:** `Skill(skill="close-work-cycle")` when closing an existing work item.

---

## The Cycle

```
[observation-capture-cycle] --> [dod-validation-cycle] --> VALIDATE --> ARCHIVE --> MEMORY --> CHAIN
         │                                                                                       |
         │                                                                                [route next]
   reflection first                                                                              |
   (RECALL->NOTICE->COMMIT)                                                             /-------------\
                                                                                       INV-*    has plan?   else
                                                                                         |         |          |
                                                                                    investigation  implement  work-creation
                                                                                       -cycle      -cycle     -cycle
```

**Entry Gates (MUST):**

1. **Observation Capture (E2-278):** Before starting this cycle, **MUST** invoke observation-capture-cycle:
   ```
   Skill(skill="observation-capture-cycle")
   ```
   This forces genuine reflection in dedicated cognitive context before entering "closing mode."

2. **DoD Validation:** Before VALIDATE phase, **MUST** invoke dod-validation-cycle:
   ```
   Skill(skill="dod-validation-cycle")
   ```
   This validates DoD criteria in an isolated bridge skill.

---

### 1. VALIDATE Phase

**On Entry:**
```bash
just set-cycle close-work-cycle VALIDATE {work_id}
```

**Goal:** Verify work item meets Definition of Done criteria.

**Guardrails (MUST follow):**
1. **Tests MUST pass** - Prompt user to confirm
2. **WHY MUST be captured** - Check for memory_refs in associated docs
3. **Docs MUST be current** - CLAUDE.md, READMEs updated
4. **Traced files MUST be complete** - Associated plans have status: complete

**Actions:**
1. Read work file: `docs/work/active/{id}/WORK.md` (or `docs/work/active/WORK-{id}-*.md` for legacy)
2. Check work directory for plans: `docs/work/active/{id}/plans/`
3. Check plan statuses - all must be `complete`
4. For INV-* items: Apply investigation-specific DoD
5. Prompt user for DoD confirmation

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Work file exists and has status: active
- [ ] All associated plans have status: complete
- [ ] User confirms: tests pass, WHY captured, docs current

**Tools:** Read, Glob, Grep

---

### 2. ARCHIVE Phase

**On Entry:**
```bash
just set-cycle close-work-cycle ARCHIVE {work_id}
```

**Goal:** Update work item status to complete.

**Note:** Per ADR-041 "status over location" - work items stay in `docs/work/active/` until epoch cleanup. The `status: complete` field determines state, not directory path.

**Actions:**
1. Run atomic close-work recipe:
   ```bash
   just close-work {id}
   ```
   This atomically performs:
   - Update `status: active` to `status: complete`
   - Update `closed: null` to `closed: {YYYY-MM-DD}`
   - Run cascade and update-status

2. Update any associated plans to `status: complete` (if not already)

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] `just close-work` succeeded
- [ ] Work file has `status: complete` and `closed: {date}`
- [ ] Associated plans marked complete

**Tools:** Bash(just close-work)

---

### 3. MEMORY Phase

**On Entry:**
```bash
just set-cycle close-work-cycle MEMORY {work_id}
```

**Goal:** Store closure summary to memory and verify governance events.

**Actions:**

#### 3a. Governance Event Check (E2-108)

1. **Check for cycle events** (soft gate - warns but does not block):
   ```bash
   just events | grep "{id}"
   ```
   - If no events found for the work ID, warn that governance may have been bypassed
   - Work item can still close, but warning surfaces potential governance bypass

#### 3b. Memory Capture

2. Store closure summary via `ingester_ingest`:
   - Title, backlog_id, DoD status, associated documents
   - Include observation summary if any captured in observation-capture-cycle
   - Use source_path: `closure:{backlog_id}`

#### 3c. Report Closure

3. Report closure to user with memory concept ID

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Governance event check completed (warning if no events)
- [ ] Closure summary stored to memory
- [ ] User informed of successful closure with memory concept ID

**Tools:** governance_events.check_work_item_events, ingester_ingest

**Note:** Status refresh is handled by `just close-work` in ARCHIVE phase (includes cascade and update-status).

---

### 4. CHAIN Phase (Post-MEMORY)

**On Entry:**
```bash
just set-cycle close-work-cycle CHAIN {work_id}
```

**Goal:** Route to next work item.

**Actions:**
1. (Closure already completed in MEMORY phase)
2. Query next work: `just ready`
3. If items returned, read first work file to check `documents.plans`
4. **Apply routing decision table** (see `routing-gate` skill):
   - If `next_work_id` is None → `await_operator`
   - If ID starts with `INV-` → `invoke_investigation`
   - If `has_plan` is True → `invoke_implementation`
   - Else → `invoke_work_creation`
5. Execute the action:
   - `invoke_investigation` -> `Skill(skill="investigation-cycle")`
   - `invoke_implementation` -> `Skill(skill="implementation-cycle")`
   - `invoke_work_creation` -> `Skill(skill="work-creation-cycle")`
   - `await_operator` -> Report "No unblocked work. Awaiting operator direction."

**MUST:** Do not pause for acknowledgment - execute routing immediately.

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Next work item identified (or none available)
- [ ] Appropriate cycle skill invoked (or awaiting operator)

**On Complete:**
```bash
just clear-cycle
```

**Tools:** Bash(just ready), Read, Skill(routing-gate)

## Composition Map

| Phase | Primary Tool | Memory Integration |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| (Entry) observation-capture-cycle | Skill | Observation capture via RECALL->NOTICE->COMMIT |
| VALIDATE | Read, Glob, Grep | Query for prior work (optional) |
| ARCHIVE | Bash(just close-work) | - |
| MEMORY | ingester_ingest | Closure summary |
| CHAIN | Bash, Skill | - |

---

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Question to Ask | If NO |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| (Entry) | Observations captured? | Invoke observation-capture-cycle first |
| VALIDATE | Does work file exist? | STOP - not found |
| VALIDATE | Are all plans complete? | STOP or warn user |
| VALIDATE | Does user confirm DoD? | STOP - DoD not met |
| ARCHIVE | Is work file archived? | Run `just close-work` |
| MEMORY | Is closure stored? | Store via ingester |
| CHAIN | Is next work identified? | Run `just ready` |

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Three phases | VALIDATE -> ARCHIVE -> MEMORY | E2-278: OBSERVE extracted to observation-capture-cycle |
| observation-capture-cycle as entry gate | Dedicated cognitive context | INV-059: Embedding causes completion mode bias |
| Keep command lookup | Skill assumes work item found | Command handles "not found" case before skill |
| Skill documents steps | Command + Skill redundancy | Command is authoritative; skill provides structure |
| MEMORY phase after archive | After archive | Memory should reflect completed state |
