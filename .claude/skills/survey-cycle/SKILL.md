# Survey Cycle

Select work after coldstart. Invoked automatically or via `Skill(skill="survey-cycle")`.

## Logic

1. **Continue prior work?**
   - Check checkpoint `pending` field
   - If work in_progress from prior session, continue it

2. **Otherwise, present options**
   - Run `just queue [name]` for ordered items (default: "default" queue)
   - Alternatively: `just ready` for flat unordered list (backward compat)
   - Select top 3 from queue head
   - Present via `AskUserQuestion` (or auto-select if autonomous)

**After queue selection:**
```bash
just set-queue {queue_name}
```

3. **Route**
   - Read work item WORK.md to get `type` field
   - Use routing decision table (WORK-014: type field takes precedence):
     - `type: investigation` OR `INV-*` prefix → `investigation-cycle`
     - Has plan → `implementation-cycle`
     - Otherwise → `work-creation-cycle`

## Gate

**MUST** select exactly one work item OR explicitly report "await_operator".

## Output

Invoke the appropriate cycle skill:
- `Skill(skill="investigation-cycle")`
- `Skill(skill="implementation-cycle")`
- `Skill(skill="work-creation-cycle")`

Or report: "No unblocked work. Awaiting operator direction."
