  "title": "Systematic Retrofit of Clarifying Questions in ADRs 001–032",
  "description": "Most ADRs (001–032) include a 'Clarifying Questions' section as required by ADR-OS-TEMPLATE.md, but the majority are shallow, generic, or contain placeholders rather than surfacing real, context-specific, actionable open issues. This undermines the intent of ADR-OS-021 (explicit assumption surfacing and risk management) and reduces the value of the ADRs for future readers, implementers, and reviewers. A systematic retrofit is required to ensure each ADR's 'Clarifying Questions' section is substantive, context-driven, and actionable.",

  "background": "The ADR-OS-TEMPLATE.md and ADR-OS-021 mandate that every ADR must end with a 'Clarifying Questions' section listing unresolved questions or areas requiring further investigation. Most ADRs currently use placeholders or generic questions, failing to surface real, actionable uncertainties. This issue follows the successful assumptions surfacing retrofit and aims to close the next major documentation compliance gap.",

    "1. ADRs with only placeholders or generic questions (highest priority)",

  "stepwise_plan": [
    "1. Inventory all ADRs 001–032 and categorize their 'Clarifying Questions' sections by depth (placeholder, generic, specific) [COMPLETED]",
    "2. For each ADR, review the context, rationale, and decision points to identify real, unresolved issues, risks, or ambiguities [COMPLETED]",
    "3. Replace placeholders and generic questions with context-driven, actionable clarifying questions [COMPLETED for all Category 1 and Category 2 ADRs]",
    "4. Ensure each section contains at least 2–3 substantive, non-redundant questions relevant to the ADR's scope and decision",
    "5. Cross-link to related issues, plans, or ADRs where appropriate for traceability",
    "6. Batch updates in ≤50 lines per file, reporting progress after each batch",
    "7. Final review for template and intent compliance (ADR-OS-TEMPLATE.md, ADR-OS-021)"

  "progress_update": "As of this update, all Category 1 and Category 2 ADRs (those with placeholders, generic, or partially contextual clarifying questions) have been systematically reviewed and retrofitted. Each now contains a set of substantive, context-driven, and actionable clarifying questions. Ready for final review or next steps as directed."
