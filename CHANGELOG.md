### Completed (Late Afternoon Session)

#### v3 Architecture Completion
Created remaining v3 adapters:
1. `phase2_tactical_ingestion_v3.py` - Keyword categorization with MCP enhancement
2. `phase3_crystal_seed_v3.py` - Deep analysis with automatic HAiOS context

Features implemented:
- All adapters now use MCP client architecture
- Mock support throughout for testing without API keys
- Consistent error handling and reporting
- All outputs properly directed to `reports/` directory

#### Source of Truth Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Rhiza v3 architecture details
- Added Rhiza test commands to CLAUDE.md
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude generated reports
- Ensured all documentation reflects current state

- Updated `mcp-config.sh` to use correct `claude mcp add` commands
- Documented SQLite MCP usage pattern in CLAUDE.md
- Fixed script to support setup/remove/info commands

#### Database Implementation
Created: `agents/rhiza_agent/database/setup_nocodb_tables.py`
- Automated NocoDB table creation
- 4 tables with full schema definitions:
  - `raw_research_artifacts` - Paper storage with integrity hash
  - `concept_extraction_reports` - Extracted concepts with tiering
  - `research_priorities` - Strategic analysis results
  - `triage_reports` - Phase 2 categorization results
- Outputs project/base IDs for .env configuration

#### Phase 1: Strategic Triage Agent
Created: `agents/rhiza_agent/adapters/phase1_strategic_triage.py`
- Deterministic paper categorization (keyword-based, no LLM routing)
- arXiv API integration with XML parsing
- Evidence chain generation with SHA-256 hashes
- High/Medium/Low relevance categorization rules
- NocoDB persistence + markdown report generation
- Separate validator class for artifact verification

Created: `agents/rhiza_agent/adapters/phase1_strategic_triage_simple.py`
- Simplified standalone version without complex dependencies
- Mock LLM client for testing without API keys
- Full implementation ready for immediate use

#### Supporting Infrastructure
- Updated `requirements.txt`: Added anthropic, openai, python-dotenv
- Created `.env.example`: Complete environment variable documentation
- Created `test_phase1.py`: Testing script for verification
- Directory structure: database/, reports/, test/

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Deterministic Categorization Logic**
   ```python
   high_keywords = ["trust", "verification", "evidence", "deterministic", ...]
   medium_keywords = ["distributed systems", "multi-agent", ...]
   # Papers categorized by keyword match count, not LLM
   ```

2. **Evidence Chain Format**
   ```json
   {
     "agent_id": "strategic_triage_builder",
     "action": {...},
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
     "hash": "SHA-256"
   }
   ```

3. **LLM Integration Pattern**
   - Anthropic > OpenAI > Mock fallback
   - LLM used for insights only, NOT routing
   - All routing decisions deterministic

## [2025-01-03] - Rhiza Agent Security Hardening

### Context
Session: Claude Code v1 // HAIOS Trust Engine Implementation
Trigger: Third-party pattern evaluation → security transformation

### Completed

#### MCP Configuration
```bash
claude mcp add filesystem      # /mnt/d/PROJECTS/haios
claude mcp add brave-search    # Web research capability
claude mcp add memory          # Knowledge persistence
claude mcp add nocodb-sqlite   # ./data/nocodb/noco.db
claude mcp add langflow-sqlite # ./data/langflow/langflow.db
```
Status: ✅ All servers configured

#### A2 (Architect-to-Architect) System
Created: `agents/{A1,A2,Scribe}/prompt.md`
- A1: The Proposer → Comprehensive solutions
- A2: The Adversarial Synthesizer → Stress-testing
- Scribe: The Synthesizer → ADR Clarification Records
Reference: `docs/templates/A2_prompt_templates.md`

#### Rhiza Agent Transformation

##### Security Architecture [NEW]
```
OLD: LLM routing → autonomous agents → self-validation
NEW: Rules only → sandboxed agents → enforced separation
```

Created Components:
1. `agents/rhiza_agent/deterministic_router.py`
   - ResearchScope → WorkflowType mapping
   - No LLM decisions // Rules only
   - Reference: ADR-OS-041

2. `agents/rhiza_agent/builder_validator_pattern.py`
   - Builder ≠ Validator invariant
   - Cryptographic signatures
   - Evidence chain enforcement
   - Reference: Appendix_B (Separation of Duties)

3. `agents/rhiza_agent/schemas/research_evidence_schema.json`
   - SHA-256 integrity verification
   - Immutable artifacts (`_locked: true`)
   - Reference: `docs/schema/` patterns

4. `agents/rhiza_agent/security_sandbox_config.yaml`
   - Resource limits: Builder(512MB) / Validator(256MB)
   - Network isolation: Builder(arxiv) / Validator(internal)
   - Reference: ADR-OS-029 (Zero-Trust)

##### Documentation Updates
- Created: `RHIZA_BLUEPRINT.md` + Security Architecture section
- Created: `THIRD_PARTY_EVALUATION.md` → recommendations.txt analysis
- Created: `README.md` → Sparse primed for AI agents
- Updated: Blueprint deployment checklist → 9 security steps

##### Cleanup
```
Moved: adapters/* → legacy/adapters/
Deleted: recommendations.txt, stage1.md
Reason: Obsolete after security transformation
```

### Key Decisions

1. **Rejected LLM Routing**
   - Risk: Non-deterministic trust chains
   - Solution: Explicit ResearchScope → WorkflowType rules
   - Reference: HAIOS "Certainty Ratchet" principle

2. **Enforced Agent Separation**
   - Risk: Self-validation vulnerability
   - Solution: Role-based agents with distinct IDs
   - Reference: ADR-OS-023 (Distributed Systems)

3. **Evidence-First Design**
   - Risk: Unverifiable claims
   - Solution: Cryptographic chain for every step
   - Reference: Core Pillar #1 (Evidence-Based Development)

### Metrics
- Files created: 11
- Files moved to legacy: 2
- Files deleted: 2
- Security vulnerabilities addressed: 4 (routing/validation/sandbox/evidence)

### References
- ADR-OS-041: Rhiza Protocol Specification
- ADR-OS-023-029: Distributed Systems Requirements
- Appendix_B: Operational Principles & Roles
- docs/templates/A2_prompt_templates.md
- rawdata/{researchleadagent,researchsubagent,basicworkflow}.txt

### Next Actions
1. Implement n8n workflows with deterministic routing
2. Create NocoDB tables per schema definitions
3. Deploy builder/validator agents in Docker
4. Test evidence chain with real arXiv papers
5. Monitor security metrics in Grafana

### Integration Points
```yaml
n8n:       Workflow orchestration
NocoDB:    State persistence  
Langflow:  Agent configuration
MCP:       External data access
```

### Error Codes
```
0 = Success
1 = Recoverable error → retry
2 = Security violation → abort + alert
```

### Invariants Established
1. Builder_ID ≠ Validator_ID // Always
2. Router = Deterministic // No LLM
3. Evidence = Required // SHA-256
4. Sandbox = Enforced // Resource limits
