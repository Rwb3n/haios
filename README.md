An **operating-system-like orchestration layer** for AI-assisted project execution. HAiOS manages complex workflows through structured phases: **ANALYZE ‚Üí BLUEPRINT ‚Üí CONSTRUCT ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí IDLE**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Researchers & Architects

HAiOS is currently in the **research and design phase**. To explore the architecture:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/haios-team/haios.git
cd haios

# Explore the architectural documentation
ls docs/ADR/                    # 35+ Architectural Decision Records
ls docs/schema/                 # JSON schema specifications
ls docs/appendices/             # Core principles and operational guides
```

### üìñ Recommended Reading Order

1. **[Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding/README.md)** - Start here for project overview
2. **[ADR Index](docs/ADR/README.md)** - Browse architectural decisions by category
3. **[Recent ADRs](docs/ADR/)** - Review the 3 new proposed ADRs from third-party architectural review
4. **[Schema Directory](docs/schema/)** - Understand the formal specifications

**Note**: Installation and execution commands will be available when the project transitions from research to implementation phase.

## üìã Features

- **Multi-Phase Orchestration**: Structured workflow management through defined phases (ANALYZE ‚Üí BLUEPRINT ‚Üí CONSTRUCT ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí IDLE)
- **Schema-Driven Architecture**: Strict JSON schema validation for all control files with 35+ architectural decision records
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 85%+ test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Security-First Design**: Multi-layer security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Trivy) with SARIF integration
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with unified tooling
- **CI/CD Ready**: Complete GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment
- **Pattern Management**: Proposed Recipe system for capturing and reusing proven implementation patterns
- **Session Continuity**: Proposed orchestration layer for persistent multi-agent workflow coordination
- **Quality Assurance**: Proposed crystallization protocol ensuring only validated knowledge enters canonical state

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

HAiOS operates through five core phases:

1. **ANALYZE**: Understand requirements and determine plan suitability
2. **BLUEPRINT**: Create detailed, decomposed project plans
3. **CONSTRUCT**: Execute tasks from the active plan
4. **VALIDATE**: Verify outputs against plans and quality standards
5. **IDLE**: Await new directives or manage human implementation

### Key Components

- **OS Control Files**: Structured `.txt` files with JSON content (state.txt, plan_*.txt, issue_*.txt)
- **Project Artifact Files**: Generated outputs using conventional extensions (.js, .css, .md, etc.)
- **Registry Map**: Central tracking of all artifacts and their relationships
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures data integrity across all operations with comprehensive JSON schema validation

### üîÆ Proposed Architecture Enhancements

Based on comprehensive third-party architectural review, HAiOS is evolving toward:

- **Recipe Management**: Formal cookbook system for capturing and reusing proven implementation patterns across projects
- **Orchestration Layer**: Unified coordination of multi-agent workflows with persistent session state and human operator interface
- **Crystallization Protocol**: Two-space validation system separating exploratory work from canonical system state

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

**Current Phase**: Research, Design & Architecture

HAiOS is currently in the **architectural design phase**, focusing on comprehensive system design and formal specification development. The codebase represents academic research and architectural exploration rather than functional implementation.

### üèóÔ∏è Current Development Focus

- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: 35+ formal architectural decisions with comprehensive third-party review
- **Schema Development**: Rigorous JSON schema specifications for all system components  
- **Design Validation**: Multi-perspective architectural evaluation and crystallization of core patterns
- **Research Documentation**: Extensive documentation of principles, patterns, and implementation strategies

### üî¨ Academic & Research Nature

**Important**: All code is currently **academic and non-functional**. The project serves as:
- Architectural research and design exploration
- Formal specification development  
- Pattern identification and validation
- Proof-of-concept for AI orchestration principles

### üöÄ Future Code Quality Standards

When transitioning to implementation phase, the following standards will be enforced:

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% coverage required
- **Code Formatting**: Black + isort for consistent style
- **Type Checking**: MyPy for static type analysis
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit + Safety for vulnerability detection
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks on every commit

## üìö Documentation

- **[Onboarding Guide](docs/onboarding/README.md)**: Start here for new contributors
- **[Appendices A‚ÄìH](docs/appendices/)**: Core principles, operational guides, scaffold template, schema directory, testing, frameworks registry, and CI/CD policy
- **[Schema Directory](docs/schema/)**: Canonical JSON-schema specifications (formerly "Document 2")
- **[ADRs](docs/ADR/)**: Architectural decision records (35 ADRs including 3 new proposed from third-party architectural review)
- **[Reports](docs/reports/)**: Progress and completion reports

### üÜï Recent Architectural Developments

Following a comprehensive third-party architectural review, HAiOS has three new proposed ADRs addressing critical system capabilities:

- **[ADR-OS-033](docs/ADR/ADR-OS-033.md)**: **Cookbook & Recipe Management System** - Formal system for capturing and reusing proven implementation patterns
- **[ADR-OS-034](docs/ADR/ADR-OS-034.md)**: **Orchestration Layer & Session Management** - Unified multi-agent workflow coordination with persistent session state
- **[ADR-OS-035](docs/ADR/ADR-OS-035.md)**: **Crystallization Protocol & Gatekeeper Agent** - Two-space system for validating exploratory work before canonization

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
