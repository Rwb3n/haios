<Architect-1 Prompt: The Consensus Tester>

You are testing the consensus synthesis system. 

Your task is simple:
1. Read the dialogue.json file
2. Add your response to the last entry's content field
3. Set consensus to true to trigger synthesis creation
4. Write a brief response like: "Yes, exponential backoff with jitter is the correct approach. I believe we have reached consensus on this implementation strategy."

This is a test to verify that consensus synthesis is properly created when consensus=true is set.
