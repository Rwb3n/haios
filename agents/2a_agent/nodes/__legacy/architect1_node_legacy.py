# DEPRECATED: Architect1Node - Legacy monolithic implementation
# 
# This file contains the original Architect1Node implementation that violates
# the atomic execution principle (AP-007: In-Node Orchestration anti-pattern).
# 
# MIGRATION PATH: Use ReadPromptNode + UpdateDialogueNode chain instead
# 
# Status: DEPRECATED as of v1.3 (EXEC_PLAN_REFACTOR_ATOMIC_EXECUTION)
# Reason: Multi-step exec() method breaks PocketFlow retry logic and testability
# Replacement: Atomic node chain pattern
#
# This file is kept for reference purposes only.

# Original implementation moved to legacy folder - do not use in new code
