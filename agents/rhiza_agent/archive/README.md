This directory contains outdated files from earlier iterations of the Rhiza agent development.

## Archived Files

### Blueprints (Superseded)
- `RHIZA_BLUEPRINT_v1.md` - Original complex blueprint (replaced by v2)
- `rhiza_blueprintv2.md` - MVP approach (replaced by v3)

### Old Implementation Patterns (Deferred to Stage 3)
- `builder_validator_pattern.py` - Complex security pattern
- `deterministic_router.py` - Rule-based routing
- `security_sandbox_config.yaml` - Security configuration

### Old Test Scripts
- `test_mvp.sh` - Tests for v2 adapters (use test_mvp_v3.sh instead)

### Old Reports
- `validation_report_mvp.md` - MVP validation results
- `revision_summary.md` - Summary of changes made

## Why Archived?

The project evolved through three major iterations:
1. **v1**: Over-engineered with complex security patterns
2. **v2**: Simplified MVP approach
3. **v3**: Claude-as-a-Service architecture (current)

These files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer part of the active codebase.
