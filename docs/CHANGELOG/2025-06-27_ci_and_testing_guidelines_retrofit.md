# Changelog: 2025-06-27 - CI/CD and Testing Guidelines Retrofit for Distributed Systems

## Summary

This update completes the project-wide retrofitting for distributed systems by aligning the CI/CD process and the core testing guidelines with the new ADRs (023-029). These changes ensure that our automation, validation, and quality assurance processes are as robust and observable as the core OS they support.

---

## 1. `CI_CD_SETUP.md` Updates

The CI/CD documentation was updated to reflect a new layer of compliance checks and procedures:

*   **New "Distributed Systems Compliance" Section:** A top-level section was added to explicitly state how the CI/CD pipeline enforces the new principles.
*   **Idempotency & Traceability:** Deployment jobs are now designed with idempotency keys. Every pipeline run is stamped with a `TRACE_ID` that is propagated through all jobs, logs, and reports for end-to-end observability.
*   **Enhanced Schema Validation:** The CI pipeline now includes a linter that fails the build if new or modified schemas do not comply with the distributed systems requirements (e.g., missing `trace_id` or `idempotency_key` fields).
*   **Security & Identity:** Jobs now log the identity of the executing agent (e.g., `GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER`) and use scoped, short-lived tokens.
*   **Updated Quality Gates & Monitoring:** Quality gates were updated to include the new schema compliance linter. Monitoring was enhanced to include trace correlation for coverage and security reports.

## 2. `docs/appendices/Appendix_F_Testing_Guidelines.md` Updates

The comprehensive testing strategy was updated to make the distributed systems requirements explicit for all testing activities:

*   **New "Distributed Systems Compliance for Testing" Section:** A new major section was added to outline the specific testing requirements derived from ADRs 023-029.
*   **Idempotent & Traceable Test Runs:** Every test run must now generate a unique `idempotency_key` and propagate a `trace_id` through all logs and result artifacts.
*   **Handling for Distributed Environments:** The guidelines now include explicit rules for handling eventually consistent results, recording failure topology in partitioned test runs, and logging the identity of the test runner agent.
*   **Enforcement:** All validation and critique agents are now mandated to audit for these new invariants during every review of test scripts and results.

This work concludes the full retrofitting of all project governance, schema, and process documentation to align with the new, robust principles for building and operating distributed systems.
