# Changelog: 2025-06-24 - Architectural Refactor for Distributed Systems

## Summary

This update represents a significant architectural evolution, hardening the HAiOS design for robust, secure, and observable operation in a distributed environment. The work involved three major initiatives: standardization of the ADR template, introduction of foundational policies for distributed systems, and a comprehensive retrofitting of all existing ADRs to align with these new policies.

## 1. ADR Template Standardization & Refactor

A new, standardized ADR template (`ADR-OS-TEMPLATE.md`) was created to enforce consistency and rigor in architectural decision-making. Key features of the new template include:

*   **Standardized Sections:** `Context`, `Assumptions`, `Decision`, `Rationale`, `Alternatives Considered`, `Consequences`, and `Clarifying Questions`.
*   **Embedded Annotation Block:** A machine-readable metadata block (`ANNOTATION_BLOCK_START` / `END`) is now mandated at the header of each ADR for automated processing and traceability.
*   **Explicit Confidence & Self-Critique:** Rationale sections now require confidence levels and self-critiques to better surface risks.

**Impact:**
*   ADRs `ADR-OS-012.md` through `ADR-OS-020.md` were refactored to conform to this new template, preserving their original intent while improving clarity and structure.

## 2. New Foundational ADRs for Distributed Systems

Based on an analysis of gaps in the existing architecture (`NEW-ADR.md`), a suite of new, cross-cutting ADRs was created to define core policies for distributed operation.

*   **ADR-OS-023:** Universal Idempotency and Retry Policy
*   **ADR-OS-024:** Asynchronous and Eventual Consistency Patterns
*   **ADR-OS-025:** Zero-Trust Internal Security Baseline
*   **ADR-OS-026:** Dynamic Topology, Health Checking, and Failure Propagation
*   **ADR-OS-027:** Global and Vector Clock Event Ordering
*   **ADR-OS-028:** Partition Tolerance and Split-Brain Protocol
*   **ADR-OS-029:** Universal Observability and Trace Propagation

**Impact:**
*   These seven ADRs provide the foundational, non-negotiable principles upon which all future distributed features will be built.

## 3. Retrofit of Existing ADRs (001-022)

Following the guidance of the `ADR-RETRO-FIT.md` plan, all existing architectural decisions were reviewed and updated to align with the new distributed systems policies.

**Methodology:**
*   A new `### Distributed Systems Implications` section was added to the `Decision` block of each relevant ADR.
*   This section explicitly references the new foundational ADRs (023-029) and describes how the ADR's decision must be implemented in compliance with those policies.

**Impact:**
*   This large-scale effort ensures that the entire body of architectural knowledge is consistent and that core functionalities like the operational loop (`ADR-OS-001`), event tracking (`ADR-OS-004`), failure handling (`ADR-OS-011`), and agent management (`ADR-OS-012`) are now specified to be idempotent, observable, secure, and partition-aware. This lays a robust and coherent foundation for Phase 2 development.
