# 2025-06-27: Systematic Assumptions Surfacing Completion Across ADRs 001–032

## Summary
This changelog documents the completion of a comprehensive, systematic review and expansion of the "Assumptions" sections across all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) 001–032 in the `/docs/ADR` directory. This work was performed in direct response to [issue_assumptions.txt](../../issues/issue_assumptions.txt), which identified incomplete surfacing of implicit and explicit assumptions in the ADRs, and mandated a retrofit for framework compliance and traceability.

## Scope of Work
- **Files Affected:**
  - All ADRs from `ADR-OS-001.md` through `ADR-OS-032.md` in `/docs/ADR/`
- **Issue Reference:**
  - [issue_assumptions.txt](../../issues/issue_assumptions.txt)
- **Change Type:**
  - Documentation retrofit, compliance enhancement, technical debt remediation

## Rationale
- **Why:**
  - The original ADRs often listed only three assumptions, omitting many implicit or context-critical assumptions. This posed a risk of context drift, incomplete compliance, and reduced auditability.
  - The retrofit ensures that all assumptions—explicit and implicit—are surfaced, validated, and traceable, in line with the system-wide mandate for assumption surfacing (see ADR-OS-021).
- **How:**
  - Each ADR was reviewed for context, rationale, and distributed systems implications. The "Assumptions" section was expanded to include:
    - All relevant implicit assumptions
    - Checkboxes for validation
    - Reference to `issue_assumptions.txt` for traceability
    - Compliance notes referencing related ADRs (e.g., ADR-OS-032)
  - All changes were ≤50 lines per file, schema- and style-compliant, and fully verbose.

## Compliance & Traceability
- **Framework Compliance:**
  - All updated ADRs now comply with the explicit assumption surfacing pattern (ADR-OS-021) and the canonical models/frameworks registry (ADR-OS-032).
  - Each "Assumptions" section now includes a reference to `issue_assumptions.txt` and, where relevant, to other compliance ADRs.
- **Traceability:**
  - This retrofit is directly traceable to [issue_assumptions.txt](../../issues/issue_assumptions.txt), which remains linked in each updated ADR.

## Process Summary
- Systematic review and update of each ADR in sequence
- Expansion of "Assumptions" sections to surface all relevant assumptions
- Addition of compliance and traceability references
- Batch progress reporting and user acceptance after each set
- Final confirmation of completion and compliance

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Maximizes clarity, auditability, and framework compliance across all architectural records
  - Reduces risk of context drift and technical debt
  - Provides a robust foundation for future compliance audits and onboarding
- **Negative:**
  - Minor increase in documentation length and authoring overhead

## Linked Artifacts
