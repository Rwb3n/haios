## Cold Start Priority

**Read in this order:**

1. **[VISION-INTERPRETATION-SESSION.md](2025-11-30-VISION-INTERPRETATION-SESSION.md)** - MANDATORY FIRST READ
   - Captures alignment correction between Operator and Agent
   - Documents the journey from misunderstanding to understanding
   - Contains canonical vision definition

2. **[../VISION_ANCHOR.md](../VISION_ANCHOR.md)** - Technical vision
   - ReasoningBank + LangExtract architecture
   - Note: Predates interpretation session, may need revision

## Vision Documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [VISION-INTERPRETATION-SESSION.md](2025-11-30-VISION-INTERPRETATION-SESSION.md) | Alignment correction, canonical vision | CANONICAL |
| [../VISION_ANCHOR.md](../VISION_ANCHOR.md) | Technical architecture vision | NEEDS REVISION |

## The Canonical Vision (Summary)

```
HAIOS exists to make the OPERATOR successful.

- Spaces = Domains where operator wants to succeed
- Memory = Engine that enables transformation AND tracks outcomes
- Epochs = Refactoring cycles (RAW → EPOCH2 → EPOCH3 → ...)
- Success = Operator achieves real-world goals (not system metrics)
- Feedback = Evidence from operator outcomes drives epoch transitions
```

**Key Insight:** System metrics (concepts extracted, query latency, etc.) are irrelevant. Only OPERATOR SUCCESS matters.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

From Vision Interpretation Session:

1. **AP-VISION-DRIFT** - Optimizing system metrics instead of operator success
2. **AP-DESTINATION-VS-ENGINE** - Treating memory as end goal instead of engine

---

## Verification Questions

Before any implementation, ask:

1. Does this help the OPERATOR succeed?
2. How will we know if it's working? (Must involve operator feedback)
3. Does this serve transformation or just storage?
4. Is success measured by operator outcomes or system metrics?
