# ADR-OS-047: Execution Status Persistence & Recovery

*   **Status**: Proposed
*   **Date**: 2024-07-07
*   **Deciders**: [List of decision-makers]
*   **Reviewed By**: [List of reviewers]

## Context

The `CONSTRUCT` phase can be a long-running process involving multiple tasks that may take minutes, hours, or even days to complete. If the OS crashes, is forcibly terminated, or encounters a system failure during execution, all progress could be lost, forcing a complete restart from the beginning. A persistence mechanism is needed to save execution state and enable recovery from interruptions.

## Assumptions

*   [ ] The filesystem provides reliable persistence for execution state data.
*   [ ] Recovery can be performed safely without corrupting partially completed work.
*   [ ] The cost of frequent state persistence is acceptable compared to the cost of losing progress.
*   [ ] The persistence and recovery logic is robust against concurrent access and race conditions.
*   [ ] The system can detect and recover from incomplete or failed recovery attempts.
*   [ ] All compliance requirements from referenced ADRs (e.g., ADR-OS-032) are up-to-date and enforced.

## Frameworks/Models Applied

This ADR applies the following canonical models and frameworks (per ADR-OS-032):

### Distributed Systems Principles v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** State persistence enables recovery from failures; addresses consistency and durability requirements in distributed execution.
- **Self-Critique:** Missing explicit handling of concurrent access to state files and potential race conditions during recovery.

### Fail-Safe Design v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Automatic state persistence and recovery mechanisms ensure system can gracefully handle interruptions and failures.
- **Self-Critique:** Recovery process itself could fail or introduce inconsistencies; needs robust validation and rollback capabilities.

### Audit Trail v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Persistent execution state provides complete audit trail of task progression and system state changes.
- **Self-Critique:** State persistence might not capture all relevant context for debugging complex failure scenarios.

### Assumption Surfacing v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Explicit assumptions about filesystem reliability, recovery safety, and persistence cost trade-offs.
- **Self-Critique:** State persistence likely has more implicit assumptions about atomicity and consistency that need surfacing.

### Performance Optimization v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Incremental state persistence minimizes overhead while maximizing recovery capability; avoids full restart costs.
- **Self-Critique:** Frequent persistence operations might impact overall system performance; needs careful balance of frequency vs. overhead.

### Idempotency v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Recovery operations must be idempotent to safely restart from persisted state without side effects.
- **Self-Critique:** Ensuring true idempotency across all task types and external dependencies is complex and error-prone.

## Decision

**Decision:**

> We introduce execution state persistence and recovery mechanisms to ensure long-running CONSTRUCT phase operations can survive system interruptions without losing progress.
>
> The system will implement:
> - Incremental state checkpointing during task execution
> - Atomic state file updates to prevent corruption
> - Recovery validation to ensure consistent state restoration
> - Rollback mechanisms for failed recovery attempts

**Confidence:** Medium

## Rationale

1.  **Progress Protection**
    *   Self-critique: Long-running operations represent significant investment; losing progress due to system failures is unacceptable.
    *   Confidence: High

2.  **Recovery Reliability**
    *   Self-critique: Recovery must be more reliable than the original execution to prevent cascading failures.
    *   Confidence: Medium

3.  **Performance Balance**
    *   Self-critique: Persistence overhead must be balanced against recovery benefits and system responsiveness.
    *   Confidence: Medium

## Alternatives Considered

1.  **No persistence - restart from beginning**
    *   Brief reason for rejection: Unacceptable for long-running operations; violates reliability requirements.
    *   Confidence: High

2.  **Full system snapshots**
    *   Brief reason for rejection: Too heavyweight; excessive storage and performance impact.
    *   Confidence: High

## Consequences

*   **Positive:** Enables reliable long-running operations with graceful recovery from failures. Reduces human intervention needed for system reliability.
*   **Negative:** Adds complexity to task execution flow. Requires careful design to avoid race conditions and ensure recovery correctness.

## Clarifying Questions

*   How frequently should state be persisted to balance performance and recovery granularity?
*   What validation mechanisms ensure recovered state is consistent and complete?
*   How are concurrent access and race conditions handled during state persistence and recovery?
*   What rollback mechanisms are in place if recovery fails or results in inconsistent state?
*   How is the audit trail for state changes and recovery operations maintained and reviewed?
