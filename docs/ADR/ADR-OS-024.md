# ADR-OS-024: Asynchronous and Eventual Consistency Patterns

* **Status**: Proposed
* **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
* **Deciders**: \[List of decision-makers]
* **Reviewed By**: \[List of reviewers]

## Context

Most inter-agent and service communication within the OS currently assumes a synchronous, request-response model. This creates tight coupling and can lead to cascading failures and poor latency, especially for operations that are long-running or don't require an immediate response. This ADR defines standard patterns for asynchronous communication to improve system resilience, scalability, and loose coupling.

## Assumptions

* [ ] A reliable and scalable message bus or event log technology (e.g., Kafka, NATS, Redis Streams) can be integrated into the OS.
* [ ] Developers and agents can correctly identify which operations are suitable for eventual consistency versus strong consistency.
* [ ] The system can tolerate the time lag inherent in eventually consistent operations.
* [ ] The asynchronous/eventual consistency patterns are robust against message loss, bus outages, and event replay errors.
* [ ] The system can detect and recover from event bus misconfiguration, partitioning, or replay attacks.
* [ ] All compliance requirements from referenced ADRs (e.g., ADR-OS-032) are up-to-date and enforced.

## Decision

**Decision:**

> We will adopt a set of standard patterns for asynchronous and eventually consistent communication between agents and services.
> 1.  **"Fire-and-Forget" Events:** For notifications and non-critical logging, agents SHOULD publish events to a central message bus without waiting for a response.
> 2.  **Sagas for Long-Running Processes:** For multi-step operations that require coordination, the Saga pattern WILL be used. A coordinating agent will emit a series of commands and wait for corresponding "success" or "failure" events, issuing compensating actions for any failures.
> 3.  **Eventual Consistency:** State that does not need to be transactionally consistent (e.g., reporting dashboards, aggregated logs) SHOULD be populated by consumers reading from an event log, embracing eventual consistency.

**Confidence:** High

## Rationale

1. **Decoupling and Resilience**
   * Self-critique: The message bus itself can become a single point of failure. It must be deployed in a highly available configuration.
   * Confidence: High
2. **Improved Performance and Scalability**
   * Self-critique: Asynchronous systems are more complex to debug and reason about, as the execution flow is not linear. Tooling for distributed tracing becomes essential.
   * Confidence: High
3. **Enabling Long-Running Workflows**
   * Self-critique: Implementing sagas correctly is complex, especially the compensating actions for rollbacks. This requires careful design and testing.
   * Confidence: Medium

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Synchronous Calls Everywhere**: The current implicit model.
   * Brief reason for rejection: Does not scale, is not resilient to component failures, and leads to poor resource utilization as threads/processes are blocked on I/O.
   * Confidence: High
2. **RPC with Callbacks**: Using direct RPC-style calls with callbacks for completion.
   * Brief reason for rejection: Creates tight, point-to-point coupling between services. The caller needs to know the address of the callee, making the topology rigid.
   * Confidence: High

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Creates a more resilient, scalable, and loosely coupled architecture. Improves perceived performance for users/callers as they are not blocked on long-running tasks. Enables complex, multi-step workflows that can survive individual component restarts.
* **Negative:** Increases the operational complexity by adding a message bus component. Requires developers to have a deeper understanding of distributed systems patterns. Makes debugging and end-to-end testing more challenging.

## Clarifying Questions

* Which specific message bus technology will be the primary standard for the OS, and how will high availability and failover be ensured?
* What are the mandatory fields, headers, and versioning requirements for all events published to the bus (e.g., trace ID, source agent, schema version)?
* How are "dead letters" (messages that repeatedly fail processing) handled, escalated, and audited for root cause analysis?
* What distributed tracing and debugging tools are required to support asynchronous workflows, and how are trace IDs propagated across event boundaries?
* What is the process for evolving and standardizing async/eventual consistency patterns as new use cases and technologies emerge?
