# ADR-OS-008: OS-Generated Reporting Strategy

* **Status**: Proposed
* **Date**: 2024-05-31
* **Deciders**: \[List of decision-makers]
* **Reviewed By**: \[List of reviewers]

---

## Context

For a human supervisor to effectively manage and trust the Hybrid_AI_OS, the system's reasoning, progress, and findings must be transparent and comprehensible. Relying on raw logs or structured data files is insufficient. The OS needs a formal mechanism to synthesize information and present it in a clear, narrative, and evidence-based format.

## Assumptions

* [ ] Human-readable reports are a critical requirement for project oversight and trust.
* [ ] Markdown is a suitable and sufficient format for these reports.
* [ ] The overhead of generating reports is an acceptable trade-off for transparency.
* [ ] Report templates and outlines are versioned and consistently applied across all report types.
* [ ] The system can detect and mitigate "report fatigue" or low-quality, formulaic self-assessments.
* [ ] All reports are linked to their source data and traceable via trace_id and event references.
* [ ] All compliance requirements from referenced ADRs (e.g., ADR-OS-032) are up-to-date and enforced.

_This section was expanded in response to [issue_assumptions.txt](../../issues/issue_assumptions.txt) to surface implicit assumptions and improve framework compliance._

## Frameworks/Models Applied

This ADR applies the following canonical models and frameworks (per ADR-OS-032):

### Traceability v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Reports provide transparent audit trail of AI reasoning, progress, and findings with clear linkage to source data and decisions.
- **Self-Critique:** Reports might oversimplify complex issues, potentially misleading human reviewers.

### Distributed Systems Principles v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Reports include trace_id references and event correlation to support distributed observability.
- **Self-Critique:** **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE:** Missing explicit discussion of report generation in distributed/partitioned scenarios.

### Self-Critique Methodology v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** All reports include mandatory self-assessment sections forcing structured critical thinking about decisions and findings.
- **Self-Critique:** AI might learn to "game" self-assessment sections, providing formulaic rather than genuinely critical answers.

### Human-Centered Design v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Reports designed for human comprehension with narrative synthesis rather than raw data dumps.
- **Self-Critique:** If reports are too verbose or frequent, could lead to "report fatigue" and be ignored.

### Assumption Surfacing v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Explicit assumptions section with checkboxes for validation about human requirements, format suitability, and overhead acceptance.
- **Self-Critique:** Only three assumptions listed; reporting strategy likely has more implicit assumptions about human reading patterns and information needs.

### Structured Thinking Enforcement v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Predefined report outlines enforce consistent, structured analysis and presentation across all AI-generated reports.
- **Self-Critique:** Maintaining consistency across different report templates could become maintenance burden.

### Evidence-Based Decision Making v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Reports synthesize evidence from multiple sources and provide clear reasoning chains for conclusions.
- **Self-Critique:** Quality of reports dependent on AI's synthesis and writing capabilities.

## Decision

**Decision:**

> The OS will be responsible for generating three primary types of human-readable reports as annotated Markdown (`.md`) artifacts: **`Analysis Report`** (post-`ANALYZE`), **`Validation Report`** (post-`VALIDATE`), and **`Progress Review`** (on-demand). Each report will follow a predefined, structured outline that includes sections for critical self-assessment.

**Confidence:** High

## Rationale

1. **Transparency & Auditability**
   * Self-critique: The reports might oversimplify complex issues, potentially misleading a human reviewer.
   * Confidence: High
2. **Exploiting the Human Constraint**
   * Self-critique: If reports are too verbose or frequent, they could lead to "report fatigue" and be ignored.
   * Confidence: Medium
3. **Durable, Shareable Artifacts**
   * Self-critique: Maintaining consistency across different report templates could become a maintenance burden.
   * Confidence: High
4. **Enforcing Structured Thinking**
   * Self-critique: The AI might learn to "game" the self-assessment sections, providing formulaic rather than genuinely critical answers.
   * Confidence: Medium

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Directly Reading JSON Files**: Rejected as inefficient, not user-friendly, and lacking narrative synthesis.
   * Confidence: High
2. **Simple Log Output**: Rejected as it lacks structure, synthesis, and a clear "final verdict" for key project phases.
   * Confidence: High

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Makes the AI's thought process visible and auditable. Provides high-quality, decision-ready information to human supervisors. Promotes more rigorous and self-critical operational behavior from the AI.
* **Negative:** Adds computational and time overhead to the OS lifecycle. The quality of reports is dependent on the AI's synthesis and writing capabilities.

## Clarifying Questions

* What are the specific schemas/outlines for each of the three report types, and how are they versioned and evolved?
* How can a human or agent trigger an on-demand `Progress Review`, and what is the audit trail for such triggers?
* What mechanisms will be in place to detect and mitigate low-quality, formulaic, or "gamed" self-assessments in reports?
* How does the system handle report generation, consistency, and traceability in distributed or partitioned environments?
* What is the process for updating, archiving, or deprecating report templates as project requirements evolve?
