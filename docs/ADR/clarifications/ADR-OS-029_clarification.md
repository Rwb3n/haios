# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-029

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Every function boundary propagates trace_id via OpenTelemetry context vars.
- Root span name pattern: `haios.<phase>.<plan_id>`.
- Traces exported to OTLP endpoint `http://localhost:4318` in dev; configurable.
- Sampling rate 100% in STRICT, 10% in DEV_FAST unless error spans.
- Logs include trace_id in structured JSON field for correlation.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **High Volume:** 100% sampling may overwhelm collector; adaptive sampling roadmap.
- **Missing Context:** Legacy code paths may drop context; tracer lint scans import graph.
- **Sensitive Data:** PII must be scrubbed from span attributes; allowlist enforced.
- **Exporter Failure:** If OTLP unavailable, spans buffered to disk up to 100 MB.
- **Overhead:** Tracing adds ~5 Âµs per span; acceptable.

## Summary
ADR-OS-029 mandates universal trace propagation through OpenTelemetry, ensuring every event, metric, and log carries a trace_id for end-to-end observability and debugging.
