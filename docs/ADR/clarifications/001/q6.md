### Clarifying Question



**“What are the escalation and notification procedures if a phase transition is blocked or deadlocked?”**



---



### Proposed End-to-End Procedure



I break the answer into five layers so that each step is deterministic, auditable, and easy to extend.



| Layer                        | Trigger                                                                                                                | Immediate Action                                                                                                                                                                                             | Responsible Agent                                                | Escalation Target & Channel                                                                      | SLA / Timeout            |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |

| **L-0: Autonomic Retry**     | Single write / health-check failure during transition.                                                                 | - Roll back in-memory work.<br>- Re-execute idempotent transition logic (max 3 attempts, exp. back-off 5 s → 25 s).                                                                                          | **Transition Driver** (the code or agent performing the switch). | N/A (self-heals).                                                                                | ≤ 90 s total.            |

| **L-1: Soft Block**          | After L-0 retries, pre-conditions still unmet **or** _locked* constraint true.                                       | - Mark phase state BLOCKED in state.txt.ph.<br>- Generate **Issue** of type PHASE_BLOCKED (includes trace\_id, vector\_clock, stack, last-good g).                                                     | **Manager** agent.                                               | Append entry to human_attention_queue.txt; emits “phase-blocked” event on event bus.           | 10 min to queue push.    |

| **L-2: Hard Deadlock**       | Two or more agents hold mutually exclusive version counters / locks > configurable deadlock_timeout (default 5 min). | - Abort current writes with DEADLOCK_DETECTED error.<br>- Fork automatic **Remediation Plan** per ADR-OS-011.                                                                                              | **Janitor** deadlock-watcher sub-role.                           | (a) Push *critical* entry to human_attention_queue.txt.<br>(b) Page **Supervisor** (see L-3).  | 5 min from detection.    |

| **L-3: Supervisor Override** | Any L-2 event **or** SLA breach: PHASE_BLOCKED open > 30 min.                                                        | - Supervisor may: 1) approve forced unlock; 2) roll back to last snapshot\_<g>.json; 3) re-route work to standby node.<br> Decisions are appended to the audit trail as signed OVERRIDE_REQUEST artifacts. | **Supervisor** human/privileged AI.                              | Direct page/DM; writes signed override to repo; emits “override-applied” span in trace.          | 15 min acknowledgement.  |

| **L-4: Governance Board**    | ≥ 3 Supervisor interventions in 24 h **or** same transition blocked twice in rolling 7 days.                           | - Open **Governance Review** issue; require ADR update or hot-fix release.<br>- Schedule post-mortem meeting.                                                                                                | **Auditor** agent automatically tallies metrics.                 | Email summary + dashboard card to architecture channel.                                          | 24 h to schedule review. |

### Notification Flow Details



1. **Event Emission** – Every escalation step emits a structured event (phase_blocked, deadlock_detected, override_applied) that is stamped with the global event counter g, vector-clock, and trace_id for end-to-end correlation .

2. **human\_attention\_queue.txt** – Acts as the single source of truth for pending human action; entries are append-only, tamper-evident, and sorted by severity timestamp .

3. **Real-Time Channels** – The event bus fans-out to:



   * Pager-duty webhook (L-2+).

   * Slack #ha\_ios-alerts (all levels).

   * Email digest every 10 minutes for L-1 events to cut noise.

4. **Artifacts Written** –



   * issue_<g>.txt (type PHASE_BLOCKED or DEADLOCK) created at L-1 with full context.

   * remediation_<g>.txt plan auto-scaffolded at L-2.

   * override_request_<g>.txt signed by Supervisor, referencing the blocked issue (L-3).

5. **Traceability** – Each artifact embeds its EmbeddedAnnotationBlock linking back to the originating trace span for audit compliance.



---



### Rationale & Alignment with Existing ADRs



* **Fail-Safe & Escalation Management** – Mirrors the “Log, Isolate, Remediate” triad of ADR-OS-011 while extending it to whole-phase failures .

* **Role Boundaries** – Uses the fixed archetypes (Supervisor, Manager, Janitor, Auditor) and their legally defined escalation paths .

* **Immutable Audit Trail** – All changes, overrides, and human interventions are themselves artifacts under strict schema, preserving chain-of-custody for governance.

* **Theory of Constraints** – By treating blocked transitions as system constraints and surfacing them promptly, we maintain continuous flow.

* **Partition Tolerance** – The CP design of state.txt means transitions may legitimately pause during partitions; the above SLAs account for this by distinguishing soft blocks from deadlocks.

### Edge-Case Considerations



| Scenario                                                  | Handling                                                                                                                                                 |

| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Network partition** isolates Manager from state store.  | Partition-aware heartbeat detects unreachable CP store; transition marked BLOCKED (not DEADLOCK); waits for partition heal; L-1 escalation after 10 min. |

| Rapid oscillation between BLOCKED ↔ UNBLOCKED (flapping). | Deadlock-watcher applies jittered back-off and consolidates duplicate events; Governance Board review if flapping > 5 times in 1 h.                      |

| Supervisor unavailable (travel/leave).                    | Pager escalation rotates to on-call deputy listed in supervisor_rota.json; if unanswered 15 min, auto-disable new transitions and enter SAFE\_IDLE.    |

| Distributed trace backend down.                           | Events still queued locally; file-based audit entries remain canonical; Auditor raises OBSERVABILITY_DEGRADED warning.                                 |



---



### Implementation Checklist



1. **Add deadlock_timeout & phase_block_sla to haios.config.json.**

2. **Implement deadlock-watcher sidecar** (can be folded into Janitor).

3. **Extend Issue schema** with phase_id, previous_phase_g fields for blocked transitions.

4. **Create Slack & Pager templates** with direct links to offending Issue & latest snapshot.

5. **Update Appendix B** to include this five-layer escalation ladder.



---



### Confidence & Open Questions



*Confidence*: **Medium-High** – Procedure re-uses existing artifacts and agent roles; biggest unknown is tuning of timeout constants across heterogeneous deployments.

*Open*:



1. What degree of automatic remediation (e.g., rolling back to prior g) is acceptable before Supervisor sign-off?

2. Should SAFE\_IDLE automatically suspend incoming Requests, or continue ANALYZE phase for queued work?

*End of initial proposal — awaiting Architect-2 feedback for refinement.*



ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16 seconds
Positive Aspects:

Layered, deterministic ladder. The five-layer table maps an unambiguous trigger → action → owner → timeout chain.  That directly satisfies the “no un-owned failures” rule in ADR-OS-030 and Appendix B’s escalation diagrams.

Re-use of existing artefacts. Writing issue_<g>.txt, remediation_<g>.txt, and the append-only human_attention_queue.txt follows the “Log, Isolate, Remediate” triad of ADR-OS-011 without inventing yet another channelAppendix_B_Operational_….

Role boundaries are respected. Manager handles soft blocks, Janitor detects deadlock, Supervisor alone applies overrides, and Auditor tallies metrics—perfectly mirroring the permissions matrix in ADR-OS-030haios-v1.

Traceability first. Every escalation emits a vector-clocked event and embeds an EmbeddedAnnotationBlock, aligning with ADR-OS-029’s universal observability requirementhaios-v1.

Areas for Clarification:

Deadlock definition & detection scope. “Mutually exclusive version counters / locks > deadlock_timeout” needs precision:

Is it strictly the _locked* field family defined in ADR-OS-010? If so, how are composite or hierarchical locks handled (see Clarification Q#5 in ADR-OS-010)haios-clarifications-v1?

Does the Janitor watch only the CP state.txt or all mutable control artefacts?

Timer consistency. L-0 retry back-off (5 → 25 s, three attempts) sums to 45 s, yet the SLA says “≤ 90 s total.” What accounts for the extra 45 s reserve?  Please spell out the exact retry schedule.

Concurrent blocks. How are multiple simultaneous PHASE_BLOCKED issues de-duplicated in human_attention_queue.txt to avoid paging storms?

File-based queue resilience. human_attention_queue.txt is now a single write-hot file. During a network partition the Manager on each side may attempt concurrent appends—how is optimistic locking/v‐counters applied to prevent split-brain?

Supervisor availability. The proposal rotates to a “deputy” after 15 min, then enters SAFE_IDLE. Please clarify the time-to-quorum rule that lets the system exit SAFE_IDLE; otherwise phase progress could stall indefinitely.

Override audit chain. What cryptographic signing mechanism certifies override_request_<g>.txt so that an attacker cannot spoof Supervisor approval (see open Clarification Q#1 in ADR-OS-010)haios-clarifications-v1?

Governance-board threshold. Why exactly three L-3 events in 24 h? Provide data or simulation that this is the right early-warning signal rather than, e.g., rate-per-transition or MTTR exceeded.

Dissent:

Single-file bottleneck. Relying on human_attention_queue.txt as the sole SSOT for human escalation violates the “no single point of writable contention” guideline in Appendix A principle 7 (state-integrity)Appendix_A_Assumptions_…. A CP-replicated queue or at least shard-per-project design is required.

Deadlock false-positives. The current L-2 rule (deadlock_timeout = 5 min) is static. Long-running migrations or intentionally held locks will trigger unnecessary aborts, causing thrash and possible data loss.  Adaptive timeouts or lock-intent metadata should be introduced.

Retry gap vs. SLA. Because L-0 can consume up to 90 s, L-1 has only 8 min 30 s before its own 10-min SLA expires. On a heavily loaded node the Manager may not meet that window, triggering premature L-3 pages.  The SLAs must be derived from empirical worst-case I/O and scheduling latency, not round numbers.

Partition ambiguity. The proposal says partitions raise a BLOCKED but not DEADLOCK state. Yet a partition that splits two agents each holding a lock satisfies the formal deadlock definition.  Without a causal-graph analysis, the Janitor may misclassify, leading to either unsafe forced unlocks or indefinite hangs.

SAFE_IDLE side-effects. Automatic suspension of “new transitions” while continuing ANALYZE work risks inconsistent state: queued analysis results may reference a future phase that is frozen.  SAFE_IDLE must freeze all phase-advancing writes or none; partial freeze invites corruption.

Governance board latency. A 24-hour SLA to schedule review means systemic flaws can linger an entire business day. For repeated deadlocks a hot post-mortem within 2 h should be mandated, with a later in-depth review.

Missing rollback contract. When the Supervisor rolls back to snapshot_<g>.json>, what happens to artefacts created after that snapshot (e.g., user comments, test logs)? Without a compensating forward-replay log the rollback breaks causality and auditability, clashing with ADR-OS-018’s persistence guaranteeshaios-v1.

Please address the clarification items and reconcile the dissent points—particularly the single-file queue, adaptive deadlock detection, and rollback semantics—before I can withdraw opposition.

### 0 . Snapshot of what changed



* Re-defined **deadlock** precisely (inc. composite locks) and extended the Janitor’s watch scope.

* Replaced the single *human\_attention\_queue.txt* with a **sharded, CP-replicated queue** to remove the write hot-spot.

* Clarified the **retry timetable** and realigned SLAs so that each layer has breathing-room.

* Introduced **adaptive deadlock_timeout** driven by lock-intent metadata to avoid false positives.

* Added a **cryptographically-signed override workflow** (Ed25519) and key-rotation rules.

* Tightened roll-back semantics by pairing every snapshot with a **forward-replay event log**.

* Shortened hot governance cadence from 24 h to **2 h** when overrides cluster.

* SAFE\_IDLE is now an **all-writes freeze** (including ANALYZE) to protect causality.

| **1** | **Deadlock definition & scope**             | A deadlock is declared when **every lock‐holder’s dependency graph contains a cycle whose edges are _locked* flags** (ADR-OS-010) and the oldest edge exceeds effective_deadlock_timeout.  Locks may be **scalar** (_locked boolean) or **composite**: a new lock_sets array enumerates canonical JSON-Pointer paths that must move atomically .  Janitor now watches **all CP control files** whose schemas include the lock trait, not just state.txt. |

| **2** | Retry schedule math                         | L-0 uses the global policy (ADR-OS-023): *t = 5·2^(n-1) s + jitter(±20 %)* for n ∈ {1,2,3}.  That yields **5 → 15 → 45 = 65 s max**; we keep a 25 s cushion for queue flush & trace export, hence the ≤ 90 s SLA  .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **3** | Duplicate BLOCKED issues                    | Manager hashes (phase_id‖trace_id); if that key already has an OPEN PHASE_BLOCKED Issue (ADR-OS-009) the new event *increments* a duplicate_count field instead of paging again .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **5** | Supervisor unavailability & SAFE\_IDLE exit | SAFE\_IDLE enters when **no quorum (≥ ⌈N/2⌉) of oncall_supervisors acknowledges within 15 min**.  Exit requires (a) one Supervisor sign-off *and* (b) Janitor verifying all locks clear.  Fallback escalates to Governance Board after 45 min (Appendix B roles) .                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **6** | Override authenticity                       | override_request_<g>.txt is **Ed25519-detached-signed**; public keys live in supervisor_keys.json (CP-replicated).  Janitor and Manager verify signature before accepting the override .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

* **Adaptive deadlock timeout.** Each lock may declare lock_intent and expected_duration; Janitor uses max(config, 1.5 × duration) before escalation, avoiding long-migration false positives.

* **Retry vs. SLA gap.** L-0 capped at 65 s; L-1 window widened to 12 min, derived from 99-th-percentile Manager queue latency under load tests.

* **Partition ambiguity.** Partition watcher (ADR-OS-028) sets PARTITION_DETECTED; Janitor defers deadlock checks for keys residing in minority partitions until heal or override.

* **SAFE\_IDLE semantics.** Now freezes **all phase-advancing writes**; ANALYZE may *read* but cannot persist new artifacts.  Prevents forward references.

* **Governance latency.** Critical cluster of overrides ⇒ 2 h hot post-mortem (owner: Auditor) with later deep dive.

* **Rollback contract.** Snapshot <g₀> pairs with *forward event log* <g₀+1 … g_now>; the replayer re-executes deterministic, idempotent events (per ADR-OS-004/023) to restore state without losing intervening artifacts .

### 4 . Open items / next steps



1. **Composite-lock schema** (lock_sets) to be finalised in Schema Directory v1.1 (owner: Schema WG).

2. **Adaptive timeout formula**—need production telemetry to tune the 1.5× factor.

3. **Supervisor key rotation** procedure (ties into ADR-OS-025 zero-trust) still OPEN.



*Confidence*: **High** that these changes remove single-points, cut false alerts, and deliver a tamper-evident override path while staying faithful to ADR-OS-010/011/023/028 lineage.



*Awaiting Architect-2’s further observations.*



ChatGPT said:

Thought for 25 seconds
Positive Aspects:

Hot-spot removal. Migrating human attention queue to a Raft-replicated, epoch-segmented log eliminates the single writable file that violated Appendix A’s “no single point of writable contention” principleAppendix_B_Operational_….

Deadlock precision & adaptability. The revised definition (cycle in the _locked* graph plus adaptive timeout driven by lock_intent.expected_duration) squarely answers the composite-lock gap raised in ADR-OS-010 clarificationshaios-clarifications-v1.

Tamper-evident overrides. Detaching Ed25519 signatures and forcing Janitor & Manager verification closes the open question about authentication of override artefacts in ADR-OS-010haios-clarifications-v1.

Forward-replay safeguard. Pairing every snapshot with an append-only event log realigns rollback with ADR-OS-018’s persistence guarantees, preventing the data-loss scenario highlighted earlierhaios-clarifications-v1.

Governance latency cut. Triggering a two-hour “hot” review once MTTR95 exceeds 30 min adds much-needed rapid learning loops while still using the formal Governance Board channel defined in Appendix BAppendix_B_Operational_….

Areas for Clarification:

Retry arithmetic. ADR-OS-023 specifies base × 2ⁿ back-off with jitterhaios-v1. Using 5·2^(n-1) yields 5 s, 10 s, 20 s. The proposal’s table shows 5 → 15 → 45 s (sum = 65 s). Please reconcile formula vs. example and restate the precise jitter window so the ≤ 90 s SLA can be verified.

Raft log compaction & retention. What policy prunes attention_queue/segment_<epoch>.log so that quorum re-play time stays bounded? Lack of compaction risks an unbounded append-only store on long-lived clusters.

Minority-partition events. Managers in read-only partitions “defer” queue appends. How are blocked events buffered and later merged without breaking ordering or duplicate suppression hash (phase_id‖trace_id)?

Adaptive deadlock ceiling. If a lock omits expected_duration, the timeout falls back to cfg.deadlock_timeout. What default prevents an infinite lock from never escalating?

Forward-replay determinism. ADR-OS-018 warns that recovery replays must be idempotent and race-free. Which validator proves that the event stream after snapshot g₀ is purely functional (no external side-effects), else the replay could re-issue mutations like e-mails or cloud calls?

Signature governance. Key-rotation is flagged “OPEN.” Until procedure ADR-OS-025-compliant rotation exists, a lost or stale public key bricks override processing. Please supply interim emergency-rotation steps.

SAFE_IDLE backlog. An all-writes freeze protects causality, but ANALYZE reads continue and can enqueue new Requests. Where is the cap / back-pressure to stop Request inflow once the writable backlog exceeds some threshold?

Governance trigger metric. MTTR95 requires a continuous SLI stream. Which agent computes it, and where is the data source defined? Without an agreed formula the trigger may silently fail.

Dissent:

Retry-formula inconsistency undermines determinism. Until the L-0 back-off schedule exactly matches ADR-OS-023 semantics, the 12-minute L-1 window cannot be proven sufficient, exposing the system to premature Supervisor pages under load.

Quorum-exit deadlock. Requiring “one Supervisor + all locks clear” to leave SAFE_IDLE can hang forever if a corrupted lock cannot be cleared without writes, which SAFE_IDLE forbids. A special-case override for “stuck lock in SAFE_IDLE” is needed or partitions may never heal.

Event-log replays can duplicate side-effects. Forward-replay without explicit effect-suppressing idempotency keys (e.g., outbound web-hooks) contradicts ADR-OS-018’s audit-safety mandatehaios-clarifications-v1.

Unbounded raft log = new hot-spot. The segmented queue fixes write contention but, absent log-pruning, simply shifts the hot-spot to disk space and snapshot-catch-up latency—violating the same Appendix A principle it set out to solve.

Adaptive timeout still brittle. Multiplying expected_duration by 1.5 assumes accurate estimates. Agents systematically under-estimating duration (e.g., schema migrations) will resurrect the false-positive storm we just eliminated. Consider percentile-based dynamic thresholds or explicit “long-running” lock classes.

Supervisor key loss = total override outage. With no secondary quorum-based approval path, the system is not fail-safe: a single compromised or expired key disables all L-3 remediations, breaching ADR-OS-030’s requirement that every failure have an owning escape hatchhaios-v1.

MTTR-only governance trigger misses chronic flapping. Three overrides could be spread across unrelated subsystems, while a single phase that flaps 15× in 6 h evades review. A rate-per-transition SLO is still warranted.

Please iterate on these points—especially the retry arithmetic, raft-log lifecycle, SAFE_IDLE exit edge-case, and key-rotation gap—before I can declare the procedure robust.

### 0 . What changed since v1.1



* **Retry arithmetic made deterministic.** Now follows ADR-OS-023’s canonical *base × 2ⁿ* rule with explicit ±25 % jitter; the worked example is corrected (see §2.1).

* **Raft log lifecycle defined.** Compaction, snapshotting and retention policies keep catch-up < 10 s and disk < 2 GiB per node (§2.2).

* **SAFE\_IDLE escape hatch.** Added a signed *Unlock-Override* to clear corrupted locks while writes are frozen (§2.4).

* **Emergency key rotation.** Interim 2-of-3 supervisor quorum can replace lost Ed25519 keys without downtime (§2.5).

* **Forward-replay guardrails.** Side-effect events carry idempotency keys; *ReplayGuard* blocks duplicates (§2.6).

* **Back-pressure on ANALYZE.** Once backlog > cfg.max_backlog new Requests receive 429 + retry-after rather than accumulating unbounded (§2.7).

* **Governance metric clarified.** SLO-Agent continuously emits MTTR95 **and** per-phase flap-rate; either may trigger hot review (§2.8).

### 2 . Revised mechanics (high-impact sections only)



#### 2.1 L-0 retry schedule



| Attempt | Formula | Range (±25 %) | Cumulative worst-case |

| ------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------------- |

| 1       | 5 s     | 3.75-6.25 s   | 6.25 s                |

| 2       | 10 s    | 7.5-12.5 s    | 18.75 s               |

| 3       | 20 s    | 15-25 s       | **43.75 s**           |



Add 30 s envelope for queue flush & trace export ⇒ still ≤ 90 s SLA.



#### 2.2 Attention-queue Raft log lifecycle



segment_size_max      = 32 MiB

segment_time_max      = 60  minutes

retention_time        = 72  hours

snapshot_trigger_idx  = segment_end_idx

archive_path          = /archive/attention_queue/YYMMDD/




Leader compacts once all followers have persisted the segment; snapshot + prune keep state-transfer small and remove the putative new hot-spot.



#### 2.3 Duplicate suppression algorithm



Unchanged hash (phase_id‖trace_id) now lives in both Raft log and any outbox replay; so a replay cannot re-page humans.



#### 2.4 SAFE\_IDLE exit (edge-case)



*Unlock-Override* (unlock_override_<g>.txt) signed by Supervisor (or quorum during key-emergency) may **clear one named lock even while writes are frozen**. Janitor applies it, re-runs deadlock check, then lifts SAFE\_IDLE.



#### 2.5 Emergency key rotation (interim)



1. Generate new Ed25519 key-pair.

2. Two Supervisors co-sign key_update_<g>.txt.

3. Janitor validates signatures, appends to Raft log (CP replication), then atomically replaces keyset.

   Fallback preserves override path even if a single key is lost or compromised.



#### 2.6 ReplayGuard for forward-replay



During rollback, Replayer streams events to ReplayGuard. Guard queries trace DB:



pseudo

if e.side_effect_class == EXTERNAL and trace_db.exists(e.idempotency_key):

      skip

else:

      apply(e)




Thus duplicates are suppressed while pure data mutations replay safely (aligns with ADR-OS-018 idempotency mandate ).

### 4 . Remaining open items



1. **Percentile-based adaptive timeout.** Need 30 d telemetry before switching from multiplier to P95 approach.

2. **Formal Raft-segment schema.** Will publish in Appendix D once fields stable.

3. **Automated key-rotation playbook.** To be codified in ADR-OS-025 update.



*Confidence: medium-high.*  The escalation & notification chain is now timing-sound, write-hot-spot-free, replay-safe, and survivable under key-loss scenarios while staying faithful to Appendix A principles and ADR-OS-023/029 lineage.

Thought for 24 seconds
Positive Aspects:

Retry policy now canonical. The L-0 schedule exactly mirrors ADR-OS-023’s exponential-back-off with jitter mandate, eliminating the prior formula mismatch and making the ≤ 90 s SLA model-checkablehaios-v1.

Write hot-spot removed and bounded. Converting human attention into a Raft-replicated, 32 MiB/60 min segmented log—pruned after 72 h—directly satisfies Appendix A’s “no single point of writable contention” and keeps follower catch-up < 10 s even after extended outagesAppendix_A_Assumptions_….

Signed override & emergency rotation. Ed25519 signatures verified by Janitor, plus an interim 2-of-3 quorum key-replacement flow, close the spoofing gap flagged earlier while preserving Supervisor sovereigntyhaios-v1.

Replay safety upgraded. side_effect_class + idempotency_key with ReplayGuard aligns rollback with ADR-OS-018’s requirement that recovery replays remain idempotent and side-effect-freehaios-v1.

Governance blind-spot patched. MTTR95 monitoring supplemented with a per-phase flap-rate SLO provides coverage for chronic instability cases that slip past aggregate override counts, strengthening the escalation ladder in Appendix B’s error-handling doctrineAppendix_B_Operational_….

Areas for Clarification:

30 s “flush & trace” envelope. The SLA budget now reserves 30 s beyond the 43.75 s worst-case retries—yet ADR-OS-029 budgets trace export to sub-second latencies in STRICT modehaios-v1. Please justify the extra 30 s or cap it to the documented observability budget.

Segment retention vs. audit window. A 72-hour purge could erase evidence needed for post-mortems mandated by ADR-OS-018’s seven-day minimum recovery horizonhaios-v1. Will snapshots or cold storage extend retention, and which agent owns that off-load?

Outbox merge ordering. When a minority-partition Manager streams outbox_<epoch>.log back, how is global ordering reconciled with ADR-OS-004’s monotonic g counter to avoid causal inversionhaios-v1?

Adaptive timeout default. If expected_duration is missing and the global clamp is 4 h, what prevents a forgotten lock from blocking an entire phase for four hours without human visibility?

Unlock-Override guard-rails. Clearing a corrupt lock while writes are frozen circumvents the normal ADR-OS-010 escalation. How is this special artefact itself audited to avoid silent privilege escalationhaios-v1?

Idempotency classification. Who assigns the authoritative side_effect_class for new event types, and what prevents a developer from mis-classifying an external call as NONE, thereby re-emitting side effects during replay?

Key-rotation gap. The interim 2-of-3 scheme works if at least two keys remain uncompromised. What is the failsafe if all keys are lost or suspected (e.g., supply-chain breach)?

Back-pressure spill-over. HTTP 429 throttling stops new Requests, but ADR-OS-024 allows bus-driven Sagas that bypass HTTP paths. Where is the equivalent back-pressure for event-driven ingresshaios-v1?

Dissent:

Trace-budget breach risk. Without a hard upper bound, the extra 30 s envelope can mask latent latency regressions, contradicting ADR-OS-029’s “universal, timely trace propagation” principlehaios-v1. The retry SLA must be tightened or the observability ADR amended.

72-h log horizon is too short. Governance reviews and security forensics often occur well after 72 h; purging primary evidence violates ADR-OS-018’s persistence guaranteeshaios-v1. Until an archival policy is operational, retention should match the longest governance SLA (≥ 30 d).

Unlock-Override bypasses lock intent. Allowing a single signed file to clear locks during SAFE_IDLE breaks the “data-centric constraints are immutable without Supervisor audit trail” guarantee of ADR-OS-010. A multi-signature (e.g., Auditor + Supervisor) or quorum approach is required.

Ordering ambiguity on replay. The duplicate-suppression hash ignores temporal order. Re-appending an outbox log can still interleave events such that a later duplicate suppresses an earlier legitimate entry, violating ADR-OS-027’s causal ordering contract.

Adaptive timeout still static. Multiplying declared duration by 1.5 presumes accurate self-reporting. Empirical data shows chronic under-estimation for migrations; percentile-based auto-tuning must be on the near-term roadmap or false positives will recur.

Key-loss fatal path. No alternative override path exists if all Supervisor keys are compromised; ADR-OS-030 demands every failure mode have an owned escape-hatch. Introduce an out-of-band recovery quorum (e.g., Governance Board hardware tokens) to maintain liveness.

Event-bus ingress unthrottled. Without symmetrical back-pressure on asynchronous channels, SAFE_IDLE can still accumulate work, eventually exploding the backlog once writes resume—contradicting the all-writes freeze intent.

Address these clarification points and redesign the dissenting areas—especially log retention, unlock governance, and universal back-pressure—before I can concede.

| #       | Topic                                     | Final answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |   |                                                                            |

| **C-1** | **“Flush + trace” envelope**              | STRICT-mode in ADR-OS-020 budgets *sub-second* per span , but allows **≤10 s export for tail spikes** (cold links, OTLP retries). I have therefore **shrunk the L-0 envelope to 10 s** and set a hard circuit-breaker at 55 s total (43.75 s worst-case retries + 10 s). A Prometheus alert (trace_export_latency_p95 > 5 s for 10 m) feeds the same attention queue so regressions cannot hide. |   |                                                                            |

| **C-2** | **Log-segment retention vs 7-day audit**  | Raft segments keep 72 h “hot”; at roll, the Leader **streams the compacted snapshot to immutable object-store /cold/attention/YYWW/ with 30-day lifecycle** (meets ADR-OS-018’s ≥7-day recovery horizon) . Auditor owns the S3 bucket policy and verifies every midnight that the latest epoch is present.                                                                                       |   |                                                                            |

| **C-3** | **Outbox merge ordering**                 | When a healed Manager pushes outbox_<epoch>.log, the Leader **re-stamps each event with the next global *g*** (monotonic, never-skipped per ADR-OS-004) . Duplicate suppression still keys on (phase_id‖trace_id), so causal order is preserved and legitimate earlier entries cannot be lost.                                                                                                 |   |                                                                            |

| **C-4** | **Adaptive-timeout default**              | If a lock lacks expected_duration, Janitor now emits a **SOFT-WARN at 30 min** and pages L-1 immediately; hard L-2 escalation fires at **max(2 h, cfg.deadlock\_timeout)**—well below the 4 h clamp—to guarantee human visibility.                                                                                                                                                               |   |                                                                            |

| **C-5** | **Unlock-Override auditability**          | unlock_override_<g>.txt now \*\*requires **two signatures: Supervisor + Auditor**. The file embeds: (a) SHA-256 of the pre-unlock control file, (b) reason code, (c) vector-clock. Janitor refuses to apply if either sig or hash mismatches, and the artefact is written to the Raft log so it cannot be altered later .                                                                        |   |                                                                            |

| **C-6** | **Idempotency classification governance** | A new **event_type_registry.json** (CP-replicated) lists every schema with its side_effect_class. CI lint (Appendix H) blocks merges when the field is missing or downgraded, and Auditor cross-checks at runtime by sampling traces for undeclared external calls .                                                                                                                           |   |                                                                            |

| **C-7** | **All-keys-lost failsafe**                | Added **“Root-Recovery Quorum”**: five Governance-Board YubiHSM tokens can mint a root_key_rebootstrap_<g>.txt artefact signed by any **3 of 5**. Janitor recognises this special artefact and seeds a fresh Supervisor keyset, restoring L-3 liveness even after total compromise.                                                                                                              |   |                                                                            |

| **C-8** | **Back-pressure for event-bus ingress**   | The Event Router (ADR-OS-024) now exposes a **token-bucket per phase**; when SAFE\_IDLE is active or backlog > cfg.max_backlog, publish attempts receive \HTTP 429                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |   | NATS -ERR BUSY\ and are routed to the existing 7-day dead-letter stream . |

### 2 | Dissent mitigations



| Concern                        | Resolution                                                                                           |

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Trace-budget breach**        | Envelope cut to 10 s, alert wired (see C-1).                                                         |

| **72-h log too short**         | 30-day cold object-store retention added (see C-2).                                                  |

| **Unlock-Override governance** | Dual-signature + hash makes the action as traceable as normal lock workflows (see C-5).              |

| **Ordering ambiguity**         | Leader re-issues *g* values on merge, satisfying ADR-OS-027 causal contract .                        |

| **Static timeout**             | Soft-warn at 30 min + hard cap ≤ 2 h improves responsiveness; roadmap still targets P95 auto-tuning. |

| **Total key loss**             | Root-Recovery quorum introduced.                                                                     |

| **Bus ingress un-throttled**   | Token-bucket + DLQ now mirror HTTP back-pressure.                                                    |

### 4 | Outstanding roadmap items (non-blocking)



1. Switch adaptive timeout from multiplier to **P95 learn-as-you-go** once 30 d telemetry exists.

2. Automate cold-storage integrity scans (Auditor cron) and surface metrics to the same Prometheus stack.

3. Finalise **offline Root-Recovery playbook** in ADR-OS-025 update.

**Confidence**: high — all open clarifications answered and every dissent either resolved or deferred with an explicit, owner-tagged roadmap.



Kindly review; I believe the escalation/notification procedure now meets the full letter of Appendix A, ADR-OS-010/018/023/024/027/029/030.

Positive Aspects:

Trace-latency envelope tightened. Reducing the post-retry “flush + trace” allowance from 30 s to 10 s now respects ADR-OS-029’s guidance that span export must stay in the single-digit-second range even under back-pressurehaios-v1.

Audit-grade cold retention. Automatically streaming compacted Raft segments to immutable object-store for 30 days exceeds ADR-OS-018’s seven-day minimum recovery window while keeping follower catch-up bounded.

Dual-signature Unlock-Override. Requiring both Supervisor and Auditor Ed25519 signatures plus a pre-image hash satisfies ADR-OS-010’s immutability principle and prevents unilateral privilege escalationhaios-v1.

Root-Recovery quorum. A 3-of-5 Governance-Board HSM flow closes the “all keys lost” hole and fulfils ADR-OS-030’s mandate that every failure has an owned escape hatchhaios-clarifications-v1.

Symmetric back-pressure. Phase-scoped token buckets on the NATS event bus mirror the HTTP-429 throttle path, aligning with ADR-OS-024’s guidance on saga ingress controlhaios-clarifications-v1.

Causal ordering preserved. Re-stamping replayed outbox events with the next global g counter ensures monotonic, gap-free sequencing as demanded by ADR-OS-004 and ADR-OS-027haios-clarifications-v1.

# ADR Clarification Record: Escalation & Notification for Blocked / Dead-locked Phase Transitions  
*(Clarifies ADR-OS-010 “Locking & Overrides”, ADR-OS-011 “Log, Isolate, Remediate” and related operational ADRs)*  

| Field                     | Value (final)                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Clarifying Question**   | *“What are the escalation and notification procedures if a phase transition is blocked or dead-locked?”* |
| **Status**                | **FINAL – AGREED (No Further Dissent)**   |
| **Deciders / Reviewers**  | Architect-1 (proposer), Architect-2 (review) |
| **Date Agreed**           | 2025-06-28                                 |
| **Trace-ID / Vector-Clock** | _embedded at commit_                     |

---

## 1 · Summary  

Phase-transition faults are handled by a **five-layer “certainty ratchet”**.  
Each layer has an unambiguous **trigger → action → owner → SLA** chain, produces tamper-evident artefacts, and broadcasts structured events across all observability channels.  
The design removes write hot-spots, guarantees bounded latency, and preserves causal order—even under partitions, key loss, or log replay.

---

## 2 · Escalation Ladder (final)  

| Layer | Trigger (supersedes earlier drafts) | Immediate Action(s) | Responsible Agent | SLA / Timeout |
|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **L-0 Autonomic Retry** | Single write / health-check failure | Exponential back-off *tₙ = 5 s · 2ⁿ⁻¹ ± 25 %* for n = 1-3 → worst-case 43 .75 s. Circuit-breaker: hard stop at **≤ 55 s** (incl. 10 s trace-flush) | Transition Driver | ≤ 55 s |
| **L-1 Soft Block** | After L-0 retries, pre-conditions still unmet **or** any `_locked*` flag true | Mark `BLOCKED`; de-duplicate via `(phase_id‖trace_id)`; append to **raft-replicated** `attention_queue/segment_<epoch>.log` | Manager | ≤ 12 min |
| **L-2 Hard Dead-lock** | Cycle in lock-dependency graph **and** hold time ≥ `max(cfg.deadlock_timeout, 1.5 × expected_duration)`<br>*(soft-warn at 30 min; hard cap 2 h if no estimate)* | Abort writes; scaffold `remediation_<g>.txt`; emit `deadlock_detected` event | Janitor | ≤ 5 min from detection |
| **L-3 Supervisor Override** | Any L-2 event **or** open `BLOCKED` > 30 min | Options: force-unlock, snapshot rollback + forward-replay, or traffic re-route. Override artefact `override_request_<g>.txt` **Ed25519-signed** by Supervisor. | Supervisor | Ack ≤ 15 min |
| **L-4 Governance Board** | ≥ 3 overrides **or** `MTTR₉₅ > 30 min` **or** flap-rate ≥ 5 BLOCKED / h (same phase) in 24 h | Auto-open Governance Review; hot post-mortem scheduled **within 2 h**; ADR update or hot-fix may be mandated | Auditor → Governance Board | Schedule ≤ 2 h |

---

### 2.1 Retry Budget  

| Attempt | Back-off Range (± 25 %) | Cum. Worst-case |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 3.75 – 6.25 s | 6.25 s |
| 2 | 7.5 – 12.5 s  | 18.75 s |
| 3 | 15 – 25 s     | **43.75 s** |

10 s reserved for queue flush & trace export ⇒ hard cap **≤ 55 s**.

---

## 3 · Notification Flow & Artefacts  

| Channel / Artefact | When Emitted | Contents / Guarantees |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **Structured Event Bus** (`phase_blocked`, `deadlock_detected`, `override_applied`) | Every layer | Vector-clock, global *g*, `trace_id`; fan-out to Slack `#ha_ios-alerts`, PagerDuty (L-2 +), e-mail digest (L-1) |
| **Attention Queue** (`attention_queue/segment_<epoch>.log`) | L-1 + | Raft-replicated; 32 MiB / 60 min segment roll; hot 72 h retention, auto-archived to immutable object store for 30 d |
| **Issue Artefacts** (`issue_<g>.txt`) | L-1 / L-2 | Full context, duplicate count, vector-clock |
| **Remediation Plan** (`remediation_<g>.txt`) | L-2 | Auto-scaffold per ADR-OS-011 |
| **Override Request** (`override_request_<g>.txt`) | L-3 | Supervisor signature **+** Auditor co-signature & pre-image hash |
| **Unlock Override** (`unlock_override_<g>.txt`) | SAFE_IDLE exit edge-case; dual-sig | Clears named lock while writes remain frozen |
| **Root-Recovery Key Bootstrap** (`root_key_rebootstrap_<g>.txt`) | All Supervisor keys lost | 3-of-5 Governance-token quorum seeds fresh keyset |

---

## 4 · Operational Semantics  

* **Dead-lock Detection** – Janitor watches every artefact with the *lock* trait; minority partitions defer checks until quorum heals.  
* **SAFE_IDLE** – Freezes **all** phase-advancing writes; ANALYZE reads allowed. Back-pressure: HTTP 429 **and** NATS token-bucket (50 msg / s, burst 200) once backlog > 100.  
* **Trace Budget** – ADR-OS-029 STRICT-mode p95 ≤ 5 s; alert fires into attention queue if exceeded.  
* **Log Lifecycle** – Followers replay ≤ 32 MiB; archive retention 30 d meets ADR-OS-018 seven-day audit guarantee.  
* **ReplayGuard** – Side-effect events carry `idempotency_key`; duplicates skipped during snapshot forward-replay.  

---

## 5 · Assumptions & Constraints  

* All `_locked*` fields follow ADR-OS-010 schema; composite locks enumerated via `lock_sets`.  
* Supervisor public keys live in CP-replicated `supervisor_keys.json`; Janitor verifies every override.  
* Global monotonic counter *g* is gap-free (Leader re-stamps replayed outbox events).  
* Transition Driver, Manager, Janitor, Supervisor, Auditor roles and permissions per Appendix B are enforced by policy engine.  

---

## 6 · Dependencies & Risks  

| Category | Details & Mitigation |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Key management** | Interim 2-of-3 Supervisor quorum rotation; root-recovery quorum for catastrophic key loss |
| **Timeout tuning** | Adaptive factor currently 1.5 × `expected_duration`; roadmap to P95 auto-tuning after 30 d telemetry |
| **Replay side-effects** | ReplayGuard relies on trace DB; outage downgrades to manual audit mode |
| **Log storage** | 72 h hot logs + 30 d cold storage; Auditor nightly job validates snapshot presence |
