# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-013

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Readiness checks run within 2s wall-clock to minimize plan latency.
- Checklist includes artifact existence, schema validity, dependency install, service reachability where specified.
- Agents log outcome (`READINESS_PASS`/`READINESS_FAIL`) with structured fields for each prerequisite.
- Registry map is refreshed (delta) prior to check to ensure latest artifact paths.
- Failures create `BLOCKER` issue and set task status to BLOCKED without consuming retry count.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **False Negatives:** Superficial checks may pass but hidden issues later cause task failure; iterative improvement backlog.
- **False Positives:** Overly strict checks block progress; guideline for minimal viable verification needed.
- **Performance:** Large dependency graphs may slow checks; caching artifact metadata helps.
- **Distributed Variance:** Environment may change between check and execution; small race window tolerated.
- **Maintenance:** Checklist evolution needed as new artifact types introduced.

## Summary
ADR-OS-013 enforces a lightweight but mandatory Readiness Check before executing any task, ensuring environmental prerequisites are satisfied, otherwise marking the task BLOCKED and raising a BLOCKER issue to trigger remediation.
