# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-010

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- All `_locked*` boolean fields are validated by schema and default to `false`.
- Agents must check lock status before any mutating write; violation triggers automatic BLOCKER issue.
- Override requests are executed only via `REQUEST` artifacts signed by supervisor key.
- Distributed writes to lock fields are serialized through optimistic `v` counters to prevent split-brain.
- Lock metadata changes (<1 KB) keep state.txt size within performance budget.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Rigidity Risk:** Over-locking freezes evolution; governance board reviews lock additions.
- **Override Latency:** Human approval may slow urgent fixes; emergency bypass protocol TBD.
- **Partial Update:** Crash mid-write could leave stale lock state; atomic write ensured via temp-file swap.
- **Schema Sprawl:** Proliferation of lock types complicates agent logic; central enum registry proposed.
- **Monitoring Gaps:** Lack of dashboard for active locks may cause blind spots.

## Summary
ADR-OS-010 introduces granular `_locked*` flags in schemas and annotations to safeguard immutable decisions. Agents encountering a `true` lock must halt, raise a BLOCKER issue, and await explicit supervisor-approved override, ensuring architectural integrity.
