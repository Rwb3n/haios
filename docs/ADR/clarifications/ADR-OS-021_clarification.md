# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-021

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- All new ADRs, plans, and connectors must include explicit Assumptions, Confidence, Self-Critique, and Clarifying Questions sections.
- CI linter (`assumption_lint`) enforces non-empty lists; placeholder text fails build.
- Confidence levels limited to enum {High, Medium, Low} for consistency.
- Legacy artifacts are scheduled for retrofit within two release cycles; technical-debt label tracks progress.
- Templates reside in `docs/templates/adr_template.md` and are version-locked via checksum.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Author Burden:** Added sections may slow documentation; training and examples mitigate.
- **Superficial Compliance:** Writers may add low-value boilerplate; peer review and CI heuristic checks needed.
- **Template Drift:** Changes require mass update of artifacts; automated script maintained.
- **Linter False Positives:** Strict parsing may block merges; incremental rollout with warning mode first.
- **Cultural Resistance:** Teams unused to self-critique may push back; governance board champions adoption.

## Summary
ADR-OS-021 mandates explicit assumption surfacing with confidence and self-critique across all system artifacts, enforced by templates and CI linting to reduce hidden risks and improve traceability.
