# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-011

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Retry policy is global: 3 attempts with exponential backoff starting at 5s.
- `FAILED` tasks automatically create `issue_<g>` and push an entry to `human_attention_queue.txt`.
- Remediation plans are labeled `remediation_<g>` and inherit context via `linked_issue_ids`.
- Validation Agent verifies remediation success before closing original issue.
- Failure logging includes stack trace, parameters, and environment snapshot for reproducibility.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Queue Overload:** Excessive failures could flood human_attention_queue; dashboard prioritization required.
- **Issue Proliferation:** Many small remediation plans may clutter history; quarterly cleanup policy recommended.
- **Misclassification:** Network partitions may mark tasks FAILED instead of BLOCKED; heuristic checks needed.
- **Retry Storms:** Misconfigured backoff could saturate resources; circuit breaker guards in executor.
- **Human Bottleneck:** Limited supervisor availability slows remediation; consider rota schedule.

## Summary
ADR-OS-011 defines a "Log, Isolate, Remediate" strategy: after exceeded retries, tasks mark as FAILED, open an Issue, escalate to human queue, and spawn a dedicated Remediation execution plan to restore progressâ€”all actions traced end-to-end.
