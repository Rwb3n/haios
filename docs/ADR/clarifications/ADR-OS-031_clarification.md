# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-031

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
<!-- List any underlying assumptions and system constraints. -->
- ADR-OS-031 presumably short; placeholder logic: treat as minor feature tag? (since content unknown)
- Pre-initiative artifacts must be agent-parseable Markdown, not binary formats.
- CI linter `preinit_artifact_lint` verifies presence of Vision, PRD/MRD, TRD, Assumption Register, Diagrams, and Execution Outline.
- Diagram files stored in `docs/diagrams/` as Mermaid or SVG; each referenced via relative link.
- Minimal fast-path template allowed only for initiatives tagged `complexity: trivial` and still requires Assumption register.
- Artifact versions tracked via front-matter `artifact_version`; changes trigger compliance re-check.

## Dependencies & Risks
<!-- Note dependent systems, upstream decisions, and associated risks. -->
- **Author Overhead:** Comprehensive artifact set may slow kickoff; templating tools mitigate.
- **Staleness:** Artifacts may drift during long initiatives; quarterly review schedule enforced.
- **Diagram Quality:** Poor diagrams reduce clarity; CI uses Mermaid syntax validation.
- **Compliance Lint False Positives:** Strict checks may block merge; allow override with `needs_override` label after review.
- **Version Conflicts:** Multiple versions of artifacts may confuse agents; registry stores only latest plus archive.

## Summary
ADR-OS-031 mandates a rigorous set of standardized, agent-readable pre-initiative source documents (Vision, PRD/MRD, TRD, Assumption Register, Diagrams, Execution Outline) to eliminate ambiguity and context drift before planning begins.
