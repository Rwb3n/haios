# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-030

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Models registry file `docs/frameworks_registry.md` lists canonical models with id, version, compliance tests.
- Agents reference models via `/registry/{id}/{version}` to avoid ambiguity.
- CI job validates each ADR cites model ids existing in registry.
- Deprecated models flagged `status: DEPRECATED`; use triggers linter warning.
- Registry updates require semantic version bump and changelog entry.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Registry Drift:** Failure to update registry breaks compliance links; governance review process.
- **Version Proliferation:** Many versions clutter; adopt LTS policy.
- **Broken Links:** ADR references to removed models flagged in CI.
- **Human Error:** Manual editing mistakes; JSON schema validation for registry file.
- **Adoption Lag:** Agents may not upgrade to new model guidelines quickly; compatibility matrix maintained.

## Summary
ADR-OS-030 defines a canonical models & frameworks registry, ensuring all architectural documents reference standardized principles and enabling automated compliance checks.
