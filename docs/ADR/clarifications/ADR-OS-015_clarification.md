# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-015

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Pattern-based slicing supports regex compatible with Python `re` syntax.
- Orchestrator caches slice results keyed by artifact hash to avoid rereading unchanged files.
- Plan authors must include fallback logic (`load_full_if_pattern_missing: true/false`).
- Security: only whitelisted files may be sliced to avoid data leakage.
- Slicing overhead kept below 50ms per artifact on median hardware.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Pattern Drift:** Heading changes break patterns; plan validation tests headings existence.
- **Over-Slicing:** Too narrow slice omits needed context; can degrade task quality.
- **Performance:** Regex on large files may be slow; line number slicing preferred when possible.
- **Security Exposure:** Malicious pattern could read sensitive sections; file whitelist mitigates.
- **Debuggability:** Hard to trace what context was actually loaded; orchestrator logs slice metadata for audit.

## Summary
ADR-OS-015 implements Precision Context Loading using optional `source_location_details` for line or pattern slicing, reducing token usage and context noise while maintaining relevant information for LLM agents.
