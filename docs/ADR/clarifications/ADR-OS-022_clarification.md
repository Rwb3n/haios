# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-022

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Inventory arrays embedded in annotation blocks must not exceed 1 000 items; GC trims older EXPIRED entries.
- Delta logs are append-only; size capped at 2 MB before rotation to `inventory_delta_<g>_arch1.log`.
- Janitor cleanup cadence default 100 global events, configurable via `haios.config.json.inventory.gc_interval_g`.
- Reservation TTL default 30 minutes if `ttl_seconds` absent.
- Builder agents have read-only access; any write attempt raises `PERMISSION_DENIED` Issue.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Zombie Reservations:** Agents crash after RESERVE; janitor must roll back; monitor orphan rate.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Manual edits to annotation may conflict with delta replay; automated patcher preferred.
- **Bloat:** Large code snippets inflate annotation; guideline recommends storing pointer to file instead.
- **Concurrency:** Simultaneous RESERVE events could race; optimistic g ordering resolves but edge cases logged.
- **Schema Evolution:** Adding new lifecycle states requires migrator script and CI schema bump.

## Summary
ADR-OS-022 introduces a two-tier Mechanical Inventory Buffer stored in annotation blocks with append-only delta logs, enabling agents to reuse resources, prevent redundant work, and maintain auditability.
