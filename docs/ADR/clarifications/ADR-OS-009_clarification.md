# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-009

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- File-system latency remains acceptable (<20 ms) for reading/writing individual issue files even at 10k+ issues.
- `issue_<g>.txt` adheres to docs/Schema/issue_schema.md, ensuring forward compatibility via `schema_version` field.
- Summary generation is event-driven; a hook updates initiative and global summaries atomically after each issue mutation.
- OS agents hold exclusive write locks on issue files during edits to avoid race conditions.
- Global summary size is capped; archived issues roll over into snapshot files.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Consistency Complexity:** Tri-level synchronization may introduce edge-case inconsistencies; mitigated with transactional updates and retry logic.
- **Scale Limits:** Large enterprise projects may outgrow file-based approach; long-term roadmap includes optional DB-backed store.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Concurrent branch edits to summary files could cause git conflicts; CI linter auto-resolves via deterministic ordering.
- **Schema Drift:** Evolution of issue schema requires migration tooling to patch historical files.
- **Visibility Gaps:** If summaries fail to update, cockpit dashboards show stale data; health checks monitor last-updated timestamps.

## Summary
ADR-OS-009 formalizes a hierarchical, file-based issue tracking system comprising individual `issue_<g>.txt` records, initiative-level summaries, and a root-level global summary. This balances granular traceability with performant oversight for supervisors and agents.
