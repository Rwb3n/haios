# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-017

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- MVP engine implemented in Python 3.11 leveraging Typer CLI and Pydantic for schema validation.
- Single-threaded sequential execution; concurrency left for Phase 2.
- Test project scaffold resides in `project_templates/`; engine assumes template availability.
- CI workflow executes engine on example plan to assert green build.
- MVP scope excludes LLM calls; any agent actions mocked via deterministic scripts.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Language Choice:** Python performance limits future scaling; rewrite risk.
- **Schema Volatility:** Early changes to schemas may break MVP; version pin and migration scripts needed.
- **Manual Plan Creation:** Human error in seed plan might skew MVP evaluation; validation tooling critical.
- **Limited Error Handling:** Happy-path focus could mask edge cases; follow-up issues expected.
- **Technical Debt:** Quick MVP decisions may require refactor in Phase 2; earmark debt items.

## Summary
ADR-OS-017 kicks off Phase 1, delivering a command-line MVP engine capable of executing a single SCAFFOLDING plan end-to-end, proving the HAiOS file-based architecture and laying groundwork for future agent integration and concurrency.

## Additional Notes
- Appendix H CI policy includes job `mvp_engine_smoke_test`.
- Future: integrate LangChain-based agent wrappers once engine stable.
