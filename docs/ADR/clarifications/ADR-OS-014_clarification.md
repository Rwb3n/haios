# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-014

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Guideline artifacts reside under `docs/guidelines/` and are referenced by artifact ID in registry.
- Agents always include relevant guideline context via `context_loading_instructions`; plan validator flags omissions.
- Guidelines are versioned with semantic tags; tasks pin a minimum compatible version.
- CI pipeline linter compares guideline checksum against registry to detect corruption.
- Guideline updates require CHANGELOG entry and reviewer approval label `guideline_update`.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Staleness:** Outdated guidelines risk incorrect behavior; quarterly review ceremonies scheduled.
- **Contradictions:** Multiple guideline docs may conflict; meta-guideline defines precedence rules.
- **Overload:** Excessive guidelines could bloat agent prompts; precision context loading mitigates.
- **Bypass:** Malicious plan might exclude guidelines; auto-validation blocks plan merge.
- **Maintenance Cost:** Continuous curation demands dedicated documentation steward role.

## Summary
ADR-OS-014 establishes a version-controlled Project Guidelines store of Markdown artifacts that agents must load and follow, serving as a single source of truth for standards and preventing AI drift.
