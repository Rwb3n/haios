# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-019

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Prometheus endpoint bound to 127.0.0.1 unless `haios.config.json.observability.public` set true.
- Metric cardinality guidelines restrict label combinations to <10k series.
- CostMeter converts OpenAI tokens to USD via configurable `usd_per_token` fetched daily.
- Grafana dashboards stored in JSON; editing via UI exports committed by CI helper script.
- Budget thresholds configurable per environment (dev/stage/prod) via config overlay.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Metric Explosion:** Uncontrolled labels could overload Prometheus; enforced regex lint.
- **Token Cost Drift:** API price changes may skew budgets; daily cron updates exchange rate.
- **Port Exposure:** /metrics endpoint may leak info; reverse proxy restricts.
- **Alert Fatigue:** Too many budget alerts reduce signal; thresholds tuned via SLO review.
- **Storage Retention:** Long-term traces consume disk; Loki/tempo integration backlog.

## Summary
ADR-OS-019 introduces a unified Observability & Budget Framework using Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, Grafana dashboards, and CostMeter budget enforcement to provide real-time visibility and guard-rails for resource usage.
