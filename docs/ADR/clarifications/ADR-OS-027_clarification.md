# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-027

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Vector clock field `vc` added to all status events and delta logs.
- g counter provides total ordering within single node; between nodes vector clocks resolve causality.
- Clock skew tolerated up to 1 s for trace timestamps; NTP sync recommended.
- Merge strategy: when two divergent event logs detected, reconciliation task merges by vc dominance.
- Tooling `vc_merge.py` shipped in scripts/ for conflict resolution.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Vector Size:** Many nodes enlarge vc; compression algorithm delta-encodes zeros.
- **Complex Reconciliation:** Manual intervention may be needed on three-way conflict.
- **Performance:** vc comparison adds cpu overhead; negligible for <50 nodes.
- **Skew:** Unsynced clocks affect human-readable time but not vc causality.
- **Data Loss:** Log truncation could lose vc history; periodic snapshot includes last vc.

## Summary
ADR-OS-027 mandates logical vector clocks attached to every state-changing event, supplementing the monotonic g counter to ensure causal ordering across distributed nodes.
