# ADR Clarification Record: ADR-OS-008

## Initial Clarification Draft (TBD)


## Assumptions & Constraints
- Human supervisors value narrative Markdown reports and will review them at least once per sprint.
- Report generation time (<30s) does not impede CI/CD throughput.
- All reports are stored under `docs/reports/` and indexed in `global_registry_map.txt`.
- Templates for Analysis, Validation, and Progress Review reports are version-controlled and backward-compatible.
- Each report embeds `trace_id`, `g` snapshot, and `vector_clock` for linkage to underlying events.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Template Drift:** Divergent report outlines across versions can confuse readers; mitigation via semantic version tags and changelogs.
- **Report Fatigue:** Excessive frequency leads to neglect; default cadence configurable via `haios.config.json`.
- **Synthesis Quality:** Poor NLP summarization may misrepresent data; manual spot checks or LLM ensemble evaluation recommended.
- **Distributed Generation:** Concurrent agents might generate conflicting reports; `v` optimistic locking on report files enforced.
- **Storage Bloat:** Historical reports accumulate; archiving policy moves older reports to cold storage.

## Summary
ADR-OS-008 mandates OS-generated, human-readable Markdown reports (Analysis, Validation, Progress Review) that narratively synthesize system state, reasoning, and evidence. Reports are fully traceable via embedded identifiers and follow standardized outlines to ensure clarity and comparability over time.
