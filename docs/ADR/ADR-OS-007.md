# ADR-OS-007: Integrated Testing Lifecycle & Artifacts

* **Status**: Proposed
* **Date**: 2025-06-08
* **Deciders**: \[List of decision-makers]
* **Reviewed By**: \[List of reviewers]

## Context

An autonomous development system can inadvertently produce flawed code or "hallucinate" test success. To ensure project quality and reliability, a rigorous, evidence-based testing lifecycle must be an explicit and non-negotiable part of the development process. Claims of success must be backed by verifiable proof.

## Assumptions

* [ ] A trusted, isolated environment is available for the `Testing Agent` to execute tests.
* [ ] `Test Results Artifacts` have a consistent, machine-parsable format.
* [ ] The `Validation Agent` has read access to both the `Test Script` and `Test Results` artifacts.
* [ ] The integrity and security of the isolated test environment is continuously monitored and enforced.
* [ ] The system can detect and handle flaky or intermittent test failures.
* [ ] All test artifacts are versioned and traceable to their source execution and agent.
* [ ] All compliance requirements from referenced ADRs (e.g., ADR-OS-032) are up-to-date and enforced.

_This section was expanded in response to [issue_assumptions.txt](../../issues/issue_assumptions.txt) to surface implicit assumptions and improve framework compliance._

## Frameworks/Models Applied

This ADR applies the following canonical models and frameworks (per ADR-OS-032):

### AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Testing lifecycle follows AAA pattern: Arrange (create test scripts), Act (execute tests via Testing Agent), Assert (validate results in VALIDATE phase).
- **Self-Critique:** System becomes dependent on integrity of Testing Agent's isolated environment.

### Separation of Duties v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Strict separation between Coding Agent (creates tests), Testing Agent (executes tests), and Validation Agent (verifies results).
- **Self-Critique:** Introduces process overhead requiring more Execution Plans and complex orchestration between agent roles.

### Evidence-Based Verification v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Claims of test success must be backed by verifiable Test Results Artifacts; no self-reporting allowed.
- **Self-Critique:** Added artifact types (Test Script, Test Results) increase complexity of data ecosystem.

### Idempotency v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Test execution can be repeated safely; Testing Agent produces consistent results for same inputs.
- **Self-Critique:** Flaky tests or intermittent failures need special handling within this lifecycle.

### Assumption Surfacing v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Explicit assumptions section with checkboxes for validation about isolated environment, artifact formats, and access permissions.
- **Self-Critique:** Only three assumptions listed; testing lifecycle likely has more implicit assumptions about test environments and failure modes.

### Zero Trust Security v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** No agent is trusted to self-report test success; independent Testing Agent and Validation Agent provide verification chain.
- **Self-Critique:** "Fox guarding the henhouse" problem eliminated but at cost of increased operational complexity.

### First-Class Citizen Principle v1.0
- **Compliance Proof:** Testing becomes first-class citizen with dedicated artifacts, agents, and lifecycle phases rather than afterthought.
- **Self-Critique:** Requires secure, isolated process for Testing Agent which adds infrastructure requirements.

## Decision

**Decision:**

> We will implement a closed-loop, evidence-based testing lifecycle with a strict **separation of duties**. A `Coding Agent` may create/update `Test Script` artifacts, but only a trusted `Testing Agent` may execute them and produce the official, "signed" `Test Results Artifact`. The `VALIDATE` phase acts as an auditor, verifying this evidence to update the quality status of source artifacts.

**Confidence:** High

## Rationale

1. **Prevents "Fox Guarding the Hennhouse"**
   * Self-critique: This introduces process overhead, requiring more `Execution Plans` and more complex orchestration between agent roles.
   * Confidence: High
2. **Evidence over Declaration**
   * Self-critique: The system becomes dependent on the integrity of the `Testing Agent`'s isolated environment.
   * Confidence: High
3. **Makes Testing a First-Class Citizen**
   * Self-critique: The added artifact types (`Test Script`, `Test Results`) increase the complexity of the data ecosystem.
   * Confidence: High

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Trust-Based Model**: Allowing the `CONSTRUCT` agent to run tests and self-report success. Rejected as fundamentally unverifiable and insecure.
   * Confidence: High
2. **Validation Phase Runs Tests**: Rejected because it conflates the concerns of *executing* tests (a `CONSTRUCT`-like activity) with *validating the results of execution* (a `VALIDATE` activity).
   * Confidence: High

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Creates a high-trust, verifiable quality assurance process. The system becomes inherently self-auditing. Dramatically reduces the risk of AI shortcuts or errors going undetected.
* **Negative:** Increased operational overhead due to more plans and artifacts. Requires a secure, isolated process for the `Testing Agent`.

## Clarifying Questions

* How is the "trustworthiness" of the `Testing Agent`'s execution environment technically enforced?
* What is the exact schema for the `Test Results Artifact`?
* How are flaky tests or intermittent failures handled within this lifecycle?
