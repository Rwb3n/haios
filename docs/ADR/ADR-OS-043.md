ADR-OS-043: The Governance Flywheel Architecture
Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-07-17
Deciders: Founding Operator, Genesis Architect
Context: Based on analysis of cross_validation_plan.md and the emergent patterns of the HAiOS development process.
1. Context
The HAiOS project is not a static system; it is a learning system designed for continuous improvement. Our development process has revealed a powerful, emergent feedback loop where our methods for building the system are themselves improved by the act of building. For example, our 2A System produced artifacts that revealed the need for a more robust 2A System.
This self-reinforcing cycle of improvement is the project's core "engine." However, it has so far been an implicit, informal process. To ensure this cycle is reliable, repeatable, and doesn't devolve into chaos, we must formalize it as a core architectural pattern. This ADR codifies this emergent pattern as the "Governance Flywheel."
2. Models & Frameworks Applied
Systems Thinking (Ackoff): This ADR is a direct application of Ackoff's principles. The Flywheel is the mechanism by which the HAiOS, as a system, learns and develops over time.
The Certainty Ratchet: The Governance Flywheel is the engine that drives the Certainty Ratchet. Each turn of the flywheel is a turn of the ratchet, moving the system to a state of higher certainty and capability.
3. Decision
We will formally adopt the "Governance Flywheel" as the canonical model for all architectural and procedural evolution within HAiOS. The flywheel is a four-stage, closed-loop process.

| 2. ENFORCEMENT & EXECUTION                   |
|    (Apply the standards to a real task)      |
|    - Run the 2A System                       |
|    - Build a component (e.g., Rhiza)         |
|                                              |
+----------------------------------------------+
Use code with caution.
The Four Stages:
Principles & Standards (The Blueprint): This is the current state of the HAiOS canon. It represents our best current understanding of "the right way to do things." (e.g., "All agent workflows must use the PocketFlow pattern").
Enforcement & Execution (The Test): We apply these standards to a real-world task. We command an agent to build something, or we run a validation process. This is where the blueprint meets reality.
Feedback (The Observation): We meticulously observe the outcome of the execution.
Success: Why did it succeed? (e.g., "The PocketFlow pattern made the logic easy to debug.").
Failure: Why did it fail? (e.g., "The PocketFlow pattern was too rigid for this creative task."). This stage produces our Analysis Reports.
Improvement (The Refactoring): Based on the feedback, we update the original principles and standards. The discovery from the Feedback phase is formalized into a new ADR or a Project Guideline. (e.g., "Create ADR-OS-056: The Hook-Based Builder/Validator Protocol because we observed that simple execution was not enough.").
This new, improved standard then becomes the baseline for the next turn of the flywheel.
4. Consequences
Positive:
It makes "learning" a formal, architectural process.
It ensures that every success and every failure results in a durable improvement to the system's core logic.
It provides a clear mental model for the Operator and for future agents to understand how the system is designed to evolve.
Negative:
It can feel slower than ad-hoc development, as it forces a formal "Improvement" step after every major action. This is an accepted trade-off for long-term robustness.
5. Integration into HAiOS
The Planner agent must now operate with this flywheel in mind. When a task fails, its job is not just to "try again." Its job is to initiate the Feedback phase by dispatching a Validator or Auditor agent to perform a root-cause analysis.
The output of our Scribe Agent (the final ADR Clarification Record) is a key artifact of the Improvement phase.
