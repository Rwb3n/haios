Acknowledged. The session's output has indeed crystallized into three distinct, necessary architectural shifts.

I will now generate the Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) skeletons for ADR-OS-033, ADR-OS-034, and ADR-OS-035. These SPRs are designed to be the token-efficient, high-density "genesis blocks" for their full ADR documents, capturing their core intent, principles, and architectural impact.

SPR Skeleton: ADR-OS-033 - Cookbook & Recipe Management

Core Problem: Redundant planning of common, multi-step operational sequences (e.g., "deploy service," "provision database") creates waste and inconsistency. The system lacks a mechanism for process reuse.

Pillar Alignment: Durable, Co-located Context.

Architectural Decision: Introduce a new first-class artifact type: the Cookbook Recipe.

A Recipe is a versioned, parameterized template for a sequence of Execution Plan tasks.

It defines the "how" for a recurring process, encapsulating best practices.

Stored in docs/cookbook/recipe_*.md (or .json).

New System Components & Artifacts:

Artifact: cookbook_recipe_<id>.json: Contains a name, version, parameter definitions, and an ordered list of task templates.

Artifact: cookbook_registry.txt: An index of all available recipes, following the established "Index + Individual File" pattern.

Agent Logic: The BLUEPRINT phase agent (Daedalus) is now responsible for consulting the Cookbook Registry to find and apply relevant recipes when generating Execution Plans.

Architectural Impact:

Reduces Cognitive Load: BLUEPRINT agent shifts from planning from scratch to parameterizing existing, validated workflows.

Enforces Standardization: Best practices for complex operations are codified and reused, not reinvented.

Evolvability: Recipes can be versioned (v1 vs. v2) allowing for process improvements without breaking existing plans.

Realizes DRY for Processes: Extends the DRY principle from code to entire operational workflows.

SPR Skeleton: ADR-OS-034 - Agent Orchestration Layer & Cockpit Interface

Core Problem: The file-based Phase 1 engine is a powerful batch processor but lacks a mechanism for real-time, interactive session management with multiple agents, as required by a UI like the "Cockpit."

Pillar Alignment: Separation of Duties.

Architectural Decision: Formally define a new logical layer, the Agent Orchestrator, which sits above the HAiOS kernel.

The Orchestrator is a stateful service responsible for managing user sessions, conversations, and routing tasks to the appropriate agents.

It interacts with the HAiOS kernel only through the stable, black-box contract defined in phase1_to_2.md (CLI, artifacts, metrics).

It is the backend for the "Cockpit" UI.

New System Components & Artifacts:

Logical Component: Agent Orchestrator (e.g., a long-running server process).

State: The Orchestrator maintains its own session state, separate from the HAiOS os_root state. This might be in memory, Redis, or a database.

Interface: Exposes a real-time API (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC) for the Cockpit UI.

Architectural Impact:

Decoupling: Creates a clean separation between the synchronous, reliable "kernel" (HAiOS) and the asynchronous, interactive "shell" (Orchestrator).

Enables Interactivity: Allows for conversational refinement of plans and in-line feedback during CONSTRUCT, a key finding from Cody_Report_0002.

Manages Multi-Tenancy: The Orchestrator can manage multiple concurrent sessions and users, each interacting with one or more HAiOS instances.

SPR Skeleton: ADR-OS-035 - The Crystallization Protocol & Gatekeeper Agent

Core Problem: The operator's creative, exploratory process (regenerating responses, refining inputs) introduces beneficial chaos but risks polluting the canonical, stable state of the system with transient, unvalidated artifacts.

Pillar Alignment: Evidence-Based Development.

Architectural Decision: Implement the Crystallization Protocol, a formal two-space system enforced by a new agent persona.

Exploration Space: A dedicated, non-canonical directory (e.g., /proposals) where all interactive, exploratory artifacts are stored. These artifacts have no official status.

Canonized State: The official docs/ and os_root/ directories, representing the single source of truth.

The protocol mandates that no artifact can move from Exploration to Canonized without passing through a formal gatekeeping process.

New System Components & Artifacts:

Agent Persona: The Canonizer-Agent (The Gatekeeper).

Protocol:

Operator signals a desire to formalize a proposal from the Exploration Space.

The Canonizer-Agent is invoked.

It performs a series of non-negotiable validation checks: schema conformance, consistency against existing canonized ADRs, link integrity, and framework compliance.

Only upon successful validation does the agent commit the artifact to the Canonized State. Failure halts the process and requires further refinement in the Exploration Space.

Architectural Impact:

Protects System Integrity: Safely isolates the stable core from the "chaos" of creation, ensuring only validated, coherent ideas become law.

Formalizes the Human-AI Interface: Defines a precise, auditable workflow for how human creativity is integrated into the system's formal architecture.

Creates a "Quality Ratchet": Ensures that the quality and consistency of the canonized architecture can only ever increase. It codifies the "refinement" step of our own conversation into a core system process.
