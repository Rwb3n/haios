## 1. **Mission / North Star**

- To harden the Core OS Engine with production-grade safety, security, observability, and developer-friendly features, delivering a "titanium-grade" v1.0.0 release.

## 2. **Key Objectives**

- **A. Core Engine:** Achieve an end-to-end scaffolding run that produces a valid, signed snapshot.
- **B. Safety & Integrity:** Guarantee the registry is never corrupted by bad writes.
- **C. Security Baseline:** Implement all security controls defined in ADR-018 (Vault, isolation, kill-switches, etc.).
- **D. Observability & Budgets:** Implement all monitoring and cost-control features from ADR-019.
- **E. Developer Mode:** Implement the `DEV_FAST` runtime mode as defined in ADR-020.
- **F. Test & CI Gate:** Achieve  85% test coverage and implement security scanning in CI.
- **G. Documentation & DR:** Update all documentation and prove disaster recovery capabilities.

## 3. **Scope Boundaries & Out-of-Scope**

- **In Scope:** All items listed in the objectives, specifically targeting the requirements of ADRs 018, 019, and 020.
- **Out-of-Scope:** Any features not specified in the Phase 1 ADRs; work related to Phase 2 (Agent Integration).

## 4. **Assumptions & Constraints**

- [x] *Assumption:* "The-then proposed ADRs 018, 019, and 020 would be ratified without significant changes." (**Confidence:** High; **Self-critique:** "This was a risk, but the ADRs were well-defined.")
- [x] *Constraint:* "The entire sprint must be completed within an 8-week timeline." (**Confidence:** High)
- [x] *Constraint:* "All implemented features must have corresponding unit and integration tests to meet the coverage goal." (**Confidence:** High)

## 5. **Dependencies & Risks**

- [x] *Dependency:* "A stable core engine from the initial part of Phase 1 is required to build upon." (**Mitigation:** The sprint was sequenced after the foundational engine work was done.)
- [x] *Risk:* "The scope of the security baseline (ADR-018) is large and could have unseen complexities." (**Mitigation:** The work was broken down into 7 sub-tasks (S1-S7) and sequenced over multiple weeks.)

## 6. **Distributed System Protocol Compliance**

- This sprint predated the formal DS Protocol ADRs (023-029), but it laid the groundwork:
  - [x] *Observability (ADR-019):* The work in this sprint was a direct precursor to the formal observability protocol, introducing structured logging, metrics, and tracing.
  - [x] *Security (ADR-018):* The baseline security work aligns with the principles of Zero Trust, particularly around process isolation and outbound controls.

## 7. **Agent/Role Protocol**

- **Execution:** All epic tasks were assigned to the `Core Development Team`.
- **Approval:** ADRs required sign-off from a second maintainer to be moved to `APPROVED`.
- **Escalation:** N/A for this tactical plan.

## 8. **Milestones & Timeline**

- **Week 1:** ADRs approved.
- **Week 2-4:** Security Baseline epics (C1-C6) completed.
- **Week 5-7:** Observability (D1-D6) and Developer Mode (E1-E3) epics completed.
- **Week 8:** Registry integrity (B1-B2) and DR drills (G) completed.
- **Final Definition of Done:**
  1. Engine passes CI with  85% coverage.
  2. `dev-fast` mode runs demo plan in <5s.
  3. Hard-kill signal is handled correctly.
  4. Overspend simulation triggers soft-kill.
  5. DR drill and data verification succeed.
- **Outcome:** `v1.0.0-titanium` tag created.

## 9. **Fallbacks & Escalation Paths**

- N/A. The tactical nature of the sprint meant any delays would push out the final release date.

## 10. **Clarifying Questions**

- All clarifying questions were resolved during the ADR approval process.
