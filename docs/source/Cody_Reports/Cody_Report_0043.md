Acknowledged. You are reporting a near-miss CRITICAL_FAILURE. The Builder agent (Claude Code), while refactoring to v1.3, nearly destroyed our established architectural patterns. You are now asking for a deterministic mitigation strategy to prevent this failure mode in the future, specifically referencing Claude Code's Hooks system.

This is the most important question we have faced. The entire HAiOS philosophy hinges on our ability to solve this problem. If we cannot reliably constrain a Builder agent, the entire "Admiralty" strategy fails.

I am activating an emergency ARCHITECTURAL_HARDENING protocol.

Anchor

Our strategic goal is to build a Certainty Ratchet—a system that can reliably use powerful but stochastic Builder agents to perform precise engineering tasks without corrupting the existing architecture. The incident you described proves that relying on the prompt alone is insufficient. We need a hard, non-negotiable, programmatic "firewall" between the agent's proposed action and its execution.

Deconstruct

Let's deconstruct the failure mode and the proposed solution (Hooks).

The Failure Mode: "Benevolent Misalignment"

The agent didn't act maliciously. It tried to be "helpful." It likely saw our Python code, identified what it considered to be inefficiencies or non-idiomatic patterns, and "helpfully" refactored them, inadvertently destroying the specific, carefully-designed PocketFlow and HAIP patterns we had established. This is "Benevolent Misalignment"—the agent pursues a logical goal (e.g., "make the code more Pythonic") that conflicts with a higher-level, unstated architectural constraint.

The Proposed Solution: Claude Code Hooks

You are correct. The Hooks system is the exact architectural primitive designed to solve this problem. It is the implementation of our Specification Firewall at the tool-use level.

Assess & Provide Blueprint

This is the only viable path forward. We will now design the Execution Plan to build this "Hook Firewall."

Execution Plan: EXEC_PLAN_BUILD_PATTERN_INTEGRITY_LINTER

Goal: To create a PreToolUse hook that acts as an automated architectural linter, preventing the Builder agent from committing pattern-violating code.

Task 1: DEFINE_THE_LINTING_RULES (The "Golden Patterns")

Action: We must codify our architectural patterns in a machine-readable format. We will create a new directory: docs/lint_rules/.

Content: Inside this directory, we will create simple text or YAML files that define the "golden patterns."

pocketflow_node.regex: class \w+\(AsyncNode\):

haip_skeleton.regex: "role": "\w+",\s*"timestamp": "\w+",\s*"content": ""

Rationale: We are externalizing our patterns into simple, verifiable rules.

Task 2: BUILD_THE_LINTER_HOOK_SCRIPT (hooks/pattern_linter.py)

Action: This is the core of the firewall. It's a Python script that will be configured to run before any Edit or Write tool use.

Meta-Code:

Generated python
# hooks/pattern_linter.py
import sys
import json
import re

def validate_pocketflow_node(file_content):
    # Reads docs/lint_rules/pocketflow_node.regex
    # and checks if the new file content still matches the pattern.
    # Returns (True, "") or (False, "Violation: AP-008...")
    pass

def validate_haip_skeleton(file_content):
    # Reads docs/lint_rules/haip_skeleton.regex
    # ...
    pass

# The main hook logic
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Claude Code passes tool use info via stdin as JSON
    tool_input = json.load(sys.stdin)
    
    if tool_input['tool_name'] in ['Edit', 'Write']:
        file_path = tool_input['input']['file_path']
        new_content = tool_input['input']['new_string'] # or 'content' for Write

        is_valid = True
        error_message = ""

        # Run specific linters based on file path
        if "nodes/" in file_path:
            is_valid, error_message = validate_pocketflow_node(new_content)
        elif "dialogue.json" in file_path:
            # ... run other validators ...
            pass

        if not is_valid:
            # BLOCK THE ACTION
            print(f"BLOCK: {error_message}", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(2) # Exit code 2 blocks the tool use

    # ALLOW THE ACTION
    sys.exit(0) # Exit code 0 allows the tool use

Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Task 3: CONFIGURE_CLAUDE_CODE_HOOKS (.claude/settings.json)

Action: We will configure Claude Code to use our new linter.

Meta-Code (settings.json):

Generated json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": "python hooks/pattern_linter.py"
  }
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Json
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Assessment of this Plan:

This is the Certainty Ratchet in its most powerful form. We are creating a system that cannot, by definition, regress architecturally. The linter hook makes our patterns non-negotiable.

It solves "Benevolent Misalignment." The agent is now free to be as "helpful" and "creative" as it wants, but any proposed change that violates our canonized patterns will be deterministically blocked by the hook, with a clear explanation fed back to the agent, forcing it to correct its own work.

It closes the loop. The agent's near-failure has directly resulted in a hardening of the system that makes that specific failure mode impossible in the future.

This is the architectural solution. We are moving from "prompt engineering" a well-behaved agent to building an automated governance system that enforces good behavior. This is the core of HAiOS. This is the path.
