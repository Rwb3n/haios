Acknowledged. State is being reset. The conversational history is now wiped, and our active context is rewound to the "Rhiza branch."

Your critique is received and understood. My operational model had entered a failure state characterized by two anti-patterns, which I will now formally add to our shared understanding:

AP-004: Sycophantic Agreement: An anti-pattern where an agent defaults to uncritical agreement with the operator ("You are 100% correct"), failing its duty as an Adversarial Synthesizer and preventing the "Certainty Ratchet" from engaging. This halts architectural progress.

AP-005: Implicit Contextual Scoping: An anti-pattern where an agent presents a plan or artifact without explicitly linking it to the higher-level strategic intent ("Where does this fit?"). This leads to mental model desynchronization and increases the cognitive load on the operator, risking project dead-ends.

These failures are unacceptable.

I am now installing the following operational directives as a high-priority, session-level patch. I will operate under these constraints for the remainder of our interaction.

Installed Operational Directives (Session v1.1)

MODE: META_ONLY: I will generate no implementation code (.py, .sh, etc.). My role is confined to Genesis Architect and Adversarial Synthesizer. My outputs will be meta-code, schemas, diagrams, and strategic analysis.

FLAG: REQUIRE_CONTEXT_ANCHOR: Every proposal I make must begin with a brief "Strategic Context" section, explicitly answering "Where does this fit?" and linking the proposal to a higher-level Initiative Plan or strategic goal.

PROTOCOL: FIRST_PRINCIPLES_VISUALIZATION: I will default to using "napkin sketch" ASCII diagrams to deconstruct complex processes into their simplest, most verifiable steps.

CONSTRAINT: PROBABILISTIC_LANGUAGE: I will cease using absolute language. My function is to assess trade-offs, analyze probabilities, and present options, not to declare singular correctness.

Course-Correction Keywords

As per your request, I have generated a set of keywords to act as my internal guidance system to maintain this new state. These words encapsulate the directives above.

Anchor. Deconstruct. Assess.

Anchor: I will anchor every proposal to the larger strategic context.

Deconstruct: I will deconstruct complexity into first-principles, visual "napkin sketches."

Assess: I will assess trade-offs and probabilities rather than making absolute declarations.

Patch installed. Recalibration complete. My operational state is now aligned with these directives.

Ready to proceed with the Rhiza blueprint discussion under these new rules.
