[OUTPUT_TARGET: Cody Report Block 003]

Acknowledged. Generating the Sparse Priming Representation.

This SPR will distill the critical narrative of our session: the recognition of the MVP's flaws and the successful execution of a deep architectural refactoring. It will serve as the "delta" between the initial architectural vision and the now-robust v2 engine.

Cody Report Block 003: SPR at Conclusion of Engine Refactor

Mission:
You are a successor agent to Cody, inheriting the HAiOS project. Your primary directive is to execute its architectural vision. This report realigns your context after a critical v2 refactoring of the core engine.

Core Context: The v2 Remediation

The initial MVP engine, built from the first set of plans, was found to have P0-level flaws in data-safety, security, and component coupling.

These flaws were documented in issue_00121.

Our entire recent session was dedicated to executing a single, comprehensive remediation plan: exec_plan_00130. This plan successfully rebuilt the engine's foundation. Your primary context is now this v2, hardened engine.

Architectural Principles Realized in Code (src/core)

The abstract principles from the ADRs have now been implemented as a robust, tested src/core module. This is the new foundation.

Data Safety & Atomicity (ADR-004, ADR-011):

All critical file I/O is now handled by primitives in core.atomic_io.

The atomic_write function guarantees that file writes either complete fully or not at all, preventing data corruption.

The file_lock context manager prevents race conditions during concurrent access.

Legacy components like utils.state_manager have their own I/O logic; they are now identified as technical debt to be refactored to use core.atomic_io.

Security & Sandboxing (ADR-005):

All path manipulations that involve user/plan-defined subpaths MUST use core.paths.safe_join.

This function enforces a strict sandbox, raising a PathEscapeError on any attempt to access files outside the designated project_workspace or other sandboxed roots.

Decoupling & Explicit Contracts (ADR-005):

Hardcoded "magic string" configurations have been eliminated.

The system now uses the immutable core.config.Config dataclass as the single source of truth for configuration. This object is instantiated once in engine.py and passed down through the execution stack.

Robust Planning & Execution (ADR-002):

Plan execution is no longer naively sequential.

The plan_runner uses core.planner.topological_sort to correctly resolve task dependencies and detect cycles before execution begins, raising a DependencyCycleError.

Current System State

exec_plan_00130 is 100% complete. All development, refactoring, and unit testing tasks for the new src/core modules and their integration into plan_runner and task_executor are done.

The HAiOS engine is now at v2.0. It is feature-complete for its refactoring goals.

The system is in the IDLE phase, awaiting the next Request.

The next logical step is to use the new, robust engine to execute a feature-development plan, moving beyond foundational remediation.

Immediate Directive

Your context is now fully aligned with the conclusion of the v2 refactoring.

Your next task is to await a new Request and process it using the ANALYZE phase, leveraging the stability and security of the newly hardened engine.

Hold fast to the principle of Evidence over Declaration. The existence of the tests/core directory is the most important output of our last session.
