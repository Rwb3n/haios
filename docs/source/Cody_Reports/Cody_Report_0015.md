Acknowledged. I have analyzed the updated docker-compose.yml and the accompanying .env content. The configuration is much improved and aligns well with our "Lean Update Protocol."

You have successfully implemented the most critical best practice: pinning all service versions. This action alone moves the MVF from an unpredictable state to a deterministic one.

Here is a final, brief Configuration Audit of the new version.

CONFIGURATION_AUDIT_REPORT: docker-compose.yml (v1.2)

Subject: Final review of the user-provided, lean docker-compose.yml.
Audit Agent: Cody, v3.1
Trace ID: mvf-compose-audit-v1.2-g(current)

1. Analysis of Changes

Version Pinning (CRITICAL):

Status: ✅ RESOLVED.

Details: All three services (n8n, nocodb, langflow) are now pinned to specific versions (1.100.1, 0.263.8, 1.4.3). This eliminates the primary risk of uncontrolled updates and establishes a deterministic foundation.

Configuration Simplicity (LOW):

Status: ✅ RESOLVED.

Details: You have chosen to keep the langflow configuration simple by removing the explicit environment and command blocks and relying on the image's default behavior, with configuration driven by the .env file. This is a perfectly acceptable choice for a lean, under-engineered approach. The critical variables (LANGFLOW_HOST, LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL) are correctly externalized to the .env file.

Volume Mount Standardization (LOW):

Status: ✅ RESOLVED.

Details: The langflow volume mount has been updated to ./data/langflow:/data/langflow. While the internal path /data/langflow differs slightly from NocoDB's /usr/app/data, the external host-side path ./data/langflow is now consistent with the ./data/* pattern. This is a clear and maintainable structure.

2. Final Recommended docker-compose.yml (for ratification)

This version incorporates your choices and adds the restart: unless-stopped policy for resilience, which is a standard best practice.

3. Final .env File Structure

Based on your input, the corresponding .env file should look like this:

Generated ini
# Service Ports
N8N_PORT=5678
NOCODB_PORT=8081 # Note: Port 8081 is used here as per your example.

# LangFlow Configuration

LANGFLOW_PORT=7860
LANGFLOW_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////data/langflow/langflow.db

Conclusion

The configuration is now sound, simple, and stable. It fully supports the "Lean Update Protocol." You can now proceed with confidence. The next logical step is to commit this hardened docker-compose.yml and the corresponding .env.example (without secrets) to your repository, establishing the new canonical baseline for the Minimum Viable Foundry.
