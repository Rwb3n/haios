# WORK-INV-025: Workflow State Machine Architecture

@docs/README.md
@docs/epistemic_state.md

---

## Context

**Problem:** Commands and skills should chain together forming a workflow state machine. Commands = state transitions, Skills = states with defined exits, Exits = controlled pathways to other commands.
---

## Current State

Work item in BACKLOG node. Awaiting prioritization.

---

## Deliverables

Investigation complete - superseded by INV-022 (Work-Cycle-DAG).

See: `docs/investigations/INVESTIGATION-INV-025-workflow-state-machine-architecture.md`
