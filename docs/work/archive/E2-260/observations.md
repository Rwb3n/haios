# Observations: E2-260

<!-- OBSERVATION CAPTURE GATE (E2-217)

     This file captures unexpected behaviors, gaps, and "I noticed..." moments
     that occurred during work execution. It prevents the "Ceremonial completion"
     anti-pattern where agents gloss over issues in the rush to close.

     REQUIREMENTS:
     1. You MUST populate at least one section OR check "None observed"
     2. Empty sections with unchecked placeholders will BLOCK closure
     3. "None observed" must be an explicit choice, not a default

     TRIGGER PHRASES (scan your memory for these):
     - "I noticed..."
     - "This is odd..."
     - "Unexpected..."
     - "TODO"
     - "Should investigate..."
     - "Workaround..."
     - "Hack..."

## Unexpected Behaviors

<!-- Things that didn't work as expected, even if you worked around them -->

- [x] **None observed** - Check this ONLY if truly no unexpected behaviors occurred

<!-- Add observations below. Format:
- [ ] [Brief description]: [What happened, what you expected, what you did]
-->

---

## Gaps Noticed

<!-- Missing features, documentation, or infrastructure that would have helped -->

- [x] **None observed** - Check this ONLY if truly no gaps were noticed

<!-- Add gaps below. Format:
- [ ] [Gap name]: [What's missing, why it matters, suggested fix]
-->

---

## Future Considerations

<!-- Ideas, improvements, or "we should..." thoughts that emerged during work -->

- [x] **None observed** - Check this ONLY if truly no future considerations

<!-- Add considerations below. Format:
- [ ] [Consideration]: [Description, potential benefit]
-->

---

## Capture Verification

<!-- HARD GATE: This section is validated before closure -->

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| At least one section populated OR all "None observed" checked | [x] | All "None observed" checked |
| No unchecked placeholder items remain | [x] | Complete |
| Observations are specific, not generic | [x] | N/A |
