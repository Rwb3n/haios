# WORK-043: Scaffold CH-001 InvestigationFracture

---

## Context

[Problem and root cause]

---

## Deliverables

<!-- VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT (Session 192 - E2-290 Learning)

     These checkboxes are the SOURCE OF TRUTH for work completion.

     During CHECK phase of implementation-cycle:
     - Agent MUST read this section
     - Agent MUST verify EACH checkbox can be marked complete
     - If ANY deliverable is incomplete, work is NOT done

     "Tests pass" ≠ "Deliverables complete"
     Tests verify code works. Deliverables verify scope is complete.

     NOTE (WORK-001): Acceptance criteria are in frontmatter (machine-parseable).
     Deliverables are implementation outputs, not requirements.
