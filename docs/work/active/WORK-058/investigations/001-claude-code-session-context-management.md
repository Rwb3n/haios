# Investigation: Claude Code Session Context Management

<!-- FILE REFERENCE REQUIREMENTS (MUST - Session 171 Learning)

     1. MUST use full @ paths for prior work:
        CORRECT: @docs/work/active/INV-052/SECTION-17-MODULAR-ARCHITECTURE.md
        WRONG:   INV-052, "See INV-052"

     2. MUST read ALL @ referenced files BEFORE starting EXPLORE phase:
        - Read each @path listed at document top
        - For directory references (@docs/work/active/INV-052/), MUST Glob to find all files
        - Document key findings in Prior Work Query section
        - Do NOT proceed to EXPLORE until references are read

     3. MUST Glob referenced directories:
        @docs/work/active/INV-052/ → Glob("docs/work/active/INV-052/**/*.md")
        Then read key files (SECTION-*.md, WORK.md, investigations/*.md)

     Rationale: Session 171 wasted ~15% context searching for INV-052 in wrong
     location because agent ignored @ references and guessed file locations.

<!-- TEMPLATE GOVERNANCE (v2.0 - E2-144)

     INVESTIGATION CYCLE: HYPOTHESIZE -> EXPLORE -> CONCLUDE

     SKIP RATIONALE REQUIREMENT:
     If ANY section below is omitted or marked N/A, you MUST provide rationale.

     Format for skipped sections:

     ## [Section Name]

     **SKIPPED:** [One-line rationale explaining why this section doesn't apply]

     Examples:
     - "SKIPPED: Pure discovery, no design outputs needed"
     - "SKIPPED: Single hypothesis, no complex mapping required"
     - "SKIPPED: External research only, no codebase evidence"

     This prevents silent section deletion and ensures conscious decisions.

     SUBAGENT REQUIREMENT (L3):
     For EXPLORE phase, you MUST invoke investigation-agent subagent:
     Task(prompt='EXPLORE: {hypothesis}', subagent_type='investigation-agent')

     Rationale: Session 101 proved L2 ("RECOMMENDED") guidance is ignored ~20% of time.
     L3 enforcement ensures structured evidence gathering.

## Discovery Protocol (RFC 2119)

| Requirement | Level | Action |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Query memory first | SHOULD | Search for prior investigations on topic before starting |
| Document hypotheses | SHOULD | State what you expect to find before exploring |
| Use investigation-agent | MUST | Delegate EXPLORE phase to subagent for structured evidence |
| Capture findings | MUST | Fill Findings section with evidence, not assumptions |

---

## Context

<!-- HYPOTHESIZE PHASE: Describe background before exploring -->

**Trigger:** [What event, observation, or question initiated this investigation?]

---

## Prior Work Query

<!-- MUST query memory before starting investigation -->

**Memory Query:** `memory_search_with_experience` with query: "[investigation topic keywords]"

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering
1. [ ] Query memory for prior learnings on topic
2. [ ] Search codebase for relevant patterns (Grep/Glob)
3. [ ] Read identified files and document findings

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing
4. [ ] Test H1: [Specific actions]
5. [ ] Test H2: [Specific actions]
6. [ ] Test H3: [Specific actions]

### Phase 3: Synthesis
7. [ ] Compile evidence table
8. [ ] Determine verdict for each hypothesis
9. [ ] Identify spawned work items

---

## Evidence Collection

<!-- EXPLORE PHASE: Document ALL evidence with sources
     MUST include file:line references for codebase evidence -->

### Codebase Evidence
