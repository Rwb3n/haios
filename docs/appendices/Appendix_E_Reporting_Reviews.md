Appendix E: Reporting & Reviews
1. Purpose
This appendix provides the canonical, version-controlled templates and schemas for all standard, OS-generated, human-readable reports. As mandated by ADR-OS-008, all Planner, Validator, and Auditor agents must adhere to these structures when generating their respective reports.
This is a Bridge Layer specification designed to ensure that all reports are consistent, auditable, and provide the necessary information for effective human oversight and decision-making.
2. Guiding Principles
All HAiOS reports must adhere to the following principles:
Objectivity: Reports must be based on verifiable facts and link directly to evidence artifacts. Avoid speculation.
Traceability: Every report must contain the necessary metadata (trace_id, source artifact IDs) to link it back to the specific context, agents, and actions that generated it.
Structure: All reports must follow the templates defined in this appendix. Free-form, unstructured reports are forbidden.
Self-Critique: A section for critical self-assessment, including a confidence score, is a non-negotiable component of every report. This is a core part of the "Certainty Ratchet."
3. Report Templates
3.1. Analysis Report Template
Generated By: Planner Agent
Phase: End of ANALYZE
Purpose: To synthesize the findings of an investigation into a Request and to propose a high-level Initiative Plan.

3.2. Validation Report Template
Generated By: Validator Agent
Phase: End of VALIDATE
Purpose: To provide the final, evidence-based verdict on a completed Execution Plan.
