Appendix I: Anti-Patterns Registry
1. Purpose
This document serves as the canonical, version-controlled registry of known architectural, procedural, and behavioral anti-patterns. The HAiOS Plan Validation Gateway and our Adversarial Synthesizer personas use this registry as a "blacklist" of flawed patterns to detect and reject.
Forcing the explicit naming and description of these failure modes is a core practice of the "Certainty Ratchet."
2. Registry of Anti-Patterns
ID	Name	Description	Why it is Harmful	Recommended Alternative / Mitigation
AP-001	Monolithic Artifact	Attempting to define a complex system (an entire initiative, all agent logic) within a single, large file or plan.	Violates Separation of Concerns; becomes unmaintainable; creates merge conflicts; prevents modular, testable components.	Deconstruct the system into smaller, single-responsibility artifacts, such as the "Atomic Node" pattern for code, or a multi-stage Initiative Plan for processes.
AP-002	Premature Hardening	Implementing production-grade security, scaling, or optimization features in a v0.1 prototype before the core functionality has been proven to work.	Wastes resources on potentially incorrect abstractions; adds complexity that slows down initial validation and learning loops; violates the KISS principle.	Build the simplest possible "happy path" first to validate the core concept. Harden and optimize in later, dedicated REFACTORING plans based on evidence from the working prototype.
AP-003	Implicit Governance	Relying on descriptive text, comments, or operator memory to enforce a rule, instead of a machine-readable, programmatically verifiable mechanism.	Prone to being ignored by both humans and AI; unauditable; not enforceable by automated tooling (linters, hooks); leads to Goal Drift.	Codify the rule in a Schema, a Test_Specification.yml, a configuration file, a dedicated Governance Hook, or a CI/CD linting check. Make the "Definition of Done" a durable artifact.
AP-004	Sycophantic Agreement	An agent (human or AI) defaults to uncritical agreement with a proposal, failing its duty as an Adversarial Synthesizer.	Prevents the "Certainty Ratchet" from engaging; allows flawed or weak architectures to proceed without being pressure-tested; halts architectural progress.	Enforce the 2A System dialogue where the Architect-2 persona is required to find flaws and provide dissent. The dialogue cannot end without a formal "No Further Dissent" statement.
AP-005	Implicit Contextual Scoping	An agent presents a plan or artifact without explicitly linking it to the higher-level strategic intent it serves ("Where does this fit?").	Leads to mental model desynchronization between agents and the operator; increases operator cognitive load; risks building components that are tactically correct but strategically useless.	Mandate the Anchor protocol step. Every plan or analysis must begin with a section that explicitly states the strategic goal it is anchored to.
AP-006	Solution-in-Search-of-a-Problem	Becoming attached to a specific technical solution (e.g., "we must use n8n") and then building complex workarounds (e.g., an "HTTP Bridge") to force that solution to fit.	Inverts the problem-solving process; leads to overly complex, brittle, and inefficient architectures. The tool starts dictating the architecture instead of serving it.	Adhere to a strict First-Principles approach. Deconstruct the goal first, then assess the simplest possible tool that achieves it. Be willing to discard a tool if it creates more friction than it solves.
AP-007	In-Node Orchestration	A PocketFlow or genai-processors Node's exec() method contains complex, multi-step orchestration logic instead of performing a single, atomic computation.	Violates the Single Responsibility Principle for nodes; breaks the framework's built-in retry mechanism; makes the node difficult to test and reuse.	The Flow graph itself should represent the orchestration. Decompose the complex node into a chain of smaller, single-purpose nodes. Each node should do one thing well.
AP-008	Disconnected-Context Response	An agent's response, while logically sound in isolation, fails to connect to the overarching strategic narrative or other recent decisions.	A symptom of cognitive load in large contexts. It breaks the coherence of the strategic dialogue and forces the operator to manually re-establish connections, increasing friction.	Implement context summarization loops (like the SummarizerNode). Use explicit Anchor protocols. Prefer a smaller number of high-quality, synthesized responses over many disconnected ones.
