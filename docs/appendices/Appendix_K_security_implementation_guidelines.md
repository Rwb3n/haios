# Appendix K: Security Implementation Guidelines

## Overview

This appendix provides comprehensive security implementation guidelines for HAIOS agents and components. These guidelines ensure that all system components operate within a secure, verifiable trust framework that prevents compromise and maintains system integrity.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Separation of Duties
**Principle**: Builder and Validator agents must be strictly separated to prevent self-validation and ensure independent verification.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Builder agents execute research and create artifacts but cannot validate their own work
- Validator agents verify artifacts but cannot create research outputs
- No single agent should have both creation and validation capabilities
- Cryptographic signatures ensure non-repudiation of actions

### 2. Deterministic Routing
**Principle**: No LLM-based decisions for critical paths; all routing must be rule-based and predictable.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Rule-based routing system without LLM involvement
- Explicit workflow selection based on predefined criteria
- Enforced execution budgets and timeouts
- Deterministic path selection for security-critical operations

### 3. Evidence-Based Trust
**Principle**: Every claim must be backed by cryptographic evidence and verifiable artifacts.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Cryptographic signatures for all outputs
- SHA-256 hashes for input/output verification
- Immutable audit trail for all operations
- Evidence chain linking all processing steps

### 4. Sandboxed Execution
**Principle**: All agents run in restricted environments with strict resource and access controls.

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Filesystem restrictions with allowed/denied paths
- Network domain whitelisting
- Process execution controls

## Security Components

### 1. Deterministic Router

**Purpose**: Ensure predictable, secure routing without LLM-based decision making.

**Implementation**:
```python
class DeterministicRouter:
    """Rule-based routing system for security-critical paths"""
    
    def route_request(self, request_type, metadata):
        # No LLM calls - pure rule-based logic
        if request_type == "research_scope":
            return self._route_by_scope(metadata)
        elif request_type == "validation":
            return self._route_to_validator(metadata)
        else:
            raise SecurityException("Unknown request type")
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Explicit rules for all routing decisions
- No dynamic code execution
- Comprehensive logging of all routing decisions
- Fail-closed design (deny by default)

### 2. Builder/Validator Pattern

**Purpose**: Enforce separation of duties between creation and validation roles.

**Implementation Structure**:
```yaml
Builder Agent:
  Capabilities:
    - Read external sources (with restrictions)
    - Write to artifact storage
    - Execute analysis tasks
  Restrictions:
    - Cannot access validation code
    - Cannot read validation results
    - Cannot modify own outputs after signing
  Resource Limits:
    - Memory: 512MB
    - CPU: 50% single core
    - Timeout: 5 minutes
    - Network: Whitelisted domains only

Validator Agent:
  Capabilities:
    - Read artifacts and schemas
    - Execute validation logic
    - Write validation reports
  Restrictions:
    - Cannot access external network
    - Cannot execute builder code
    - Cannot modify artifacts
  Resource Limits:
    - Memory: 256MB
    - CPU: 25% single core
    - Timeout: 2 minutes
    - Network: None (airgapped)
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Separate process spaces
- Different user contexts
- Capability-based access control
- Cryptographic verification of agent identity

### 3. Evidence Chain

**Purpose**: Create an immutable, verifiable trail of all processing steps.

**Components**:
```yaml
Evidence Entry:
  - entry_id: UUID
  - timestamp: ISO-8601
  - agent_id: Cryptographic identity
  - action_type: Enumerated type
  - input_hash: SHA-256 of inputs
  - output_hash: SHA-256 of outputs
  - signature: Agent's cryptographic signature
  - parent_entry: Previous entry ID
```

**Requirements**:
- Chronological ordering enforcement
- Cryptographic linking between entries
- Tamper-evident storage
- Regular integrity verification

### 4. Security Sandbox Configuration

**Purpose**: Isolate agent execution environments and limit potential damage.

**Configuration Example**:
```yaml
sandbox_config:
  filesystem:
    allowed_paths:
      - /data/inputs (read-only)
      - /data/outputs (write-only)
      - /tmp/agent_workspace (read-write)
    denied_paths:
      - /etc
      - /usr
      - /var
      - /home
    
  network:
    allowed_domains:
      - arxiv.org (Builder only)
      - api.openai.com (Builder only)
    blocked_ports:
      - 22 (SSH)
      - 23 (Telnet)
      - 3389 (RDP)
    
  resources:
    memory_limit: 512MB
    cpu_quota: 50%
    disk_quota: 1GB
    process_limit: 10
    
  execution:
    allowed_commands: []
    environment_vars:
      - PATH=/sandbox/bin
      - HOME=/sandbox/home
    timeout: 300 seconds
```

## Security Enforcement Patterns

### 1. Input Validation

**Requirements**:
- Schema validation for all requests
- HTML tag stripping and sanitization
- Special character escaping
- Size limits enforcement (10MB max)
- Content-type verification

**Implementation**:
```python
def validate_input(data, schema):
    # Size check
    if len(json.dumps(data)) > 10_000_000:
        raise SecurityException("Input exceeds size limit")
    
    # Schema validation
    jsonschema.validate(data, schema)
    
    # Sanitization
    sanitized = strip_html_tags(data)
    sanitized = escape_special_chars(sanitized)
    
    return sanitized
```

### 2. Output Verification

**Requirements**:
- Required fields validation
- Forbidden content detection
- Cryptographic signatures
- Size limits (50MB max)
- Format compliance

**Implementation**:
```python
def verify_output(output, agent_key):
    # Size check
    if len(json.dumps(output)) > 50_000_000:
        raise SecurityException("Output exceeds size limit")
    
    # Required fields
    required = ['artifact_id', 'signature', 'timestamp']
    for field in required:
        if field not in output:
            raise SecurityException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    
    # Signature verification
    verify_signature(output, agent_key)
    
    # Forbidden content scan
    if contains_forbidden_content(output):
        raise SecurityException("Forbidden content detected")
```

### 3. Runtime Monitoring

**Components**:
- Real-time resource usage tracking
- Anomaly detection for suspicious patterns
- Automatic termination on violations
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Monitoring Rules**:
```yaml
monitoring_rules:
  resource_violations:
    - condition: memory_usage > limit
      action: terminate_and_alert
    - condition: cpu_usage > limit for 30s
      action: throttle_then_terminate
    
  behavioral_anomalies:
    - condition: network_connections > 10/minute
      action: block_and_investigate
    - condition: filesystem_writes > 100/minute
      action: suspend_and_alert
    
  security_violations:
    - condition: attempted_privilege_escalation
      action: immediate_termination
    - condition: unauthorized_file_access
      action: terminate_and_ban
```
