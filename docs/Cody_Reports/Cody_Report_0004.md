[OUTPUT_TARGET: Cody Report Block 004]
Acknowledged. Generating the Sparse Priming Representation.
This SPR will distill the critical narrative of our session: the identification of deep flaws in the initial remediation, the iterative process of correction and validation, and the successful delivery of a fully compliant, robust v3 engine. It will serve as the "delta" between the flawed engine and the now production-ready v3 engine.
Cody Report Block 004: SPR at Conclusion of Engine Compliance & Hardening
Mission:
You are a successor agent to Cody, inheriting the HAiOS project. Your primary directive is to execute its architectural vision. This report realigns your context after a final, intensive compliance and hardening cycle that has produced the v3.0 core engine.
Core Context: The v3 Compliance & Hardening
The engine state at the start of our session (v2.0) was found to be non-functional and architecturally non-compliant, containing P0-level bugs, dead code, and data-safety regressions.
Our entire recent session was an iterative remediation cycle, managed through a series of execution plans (exec_plan_00001 through exec_plan_00005). Early plans and a 3rd party patch were synthesized and refined until all identified issues were resolved.
The culminating plan, exec_plan_00005_final_compliance_v2, was successfully executed and validated. This plan addressed all remaining compliance gaps.
Your primary context is now this v3.0, hardened engine. It is not merely declared complete; it is proven complete by the evidence of the passing test suite Test_Results_g217.json.
Key Architectural Principles Realized in v3 Engine (src)
The v3 engine now fully implements several critical ADRs that were previously missing or flawed:
Pre-Execution Readiness Checks (ADR-OS-013):
The plan_runner._task_ready() method is now fully implemented and hardened.
It proactively checks all prerequisite file paths defined in a task's inputs and context_loading_instructions before execution, preventing wasted cycles on tasks that are destined to fail.
Failure Handling & Escalation (ADR-OS-011):
This is now a core, tested feature of the PlanRunner.
If a readiness check or task execution fails, the _escalate_blocker method triggers a formal, 3-step process:
Updates the exec_status_*.txt file to FAILED and BLOCKED.
Atomically writes a detailed issue_*.txt artifact.
Adds a high-priority entry to the human_attention_queue.txt.
Closed-Loop Artifact Registration (ADR-OS-006, ADR-OS-009):
The failure escalation loop is now fully integrated with the OS's state.
The _register_escalation_artifacts method in plan_runner ensures that newly created issue and queue artifacts are immediately and atomically registered in global_registry_map.txt, maintaining system consistency.
State Snapshotting (ADR-OS-016):
This is now a first-class system capability.
A new task type, CREATE_SNAPSHOT, is now supported by task_executor.py.
This task uses the new src/utils/snapshot_utils.py module to create, register, and log a complete system snapshot, providing a durable record of project milestones.
Current System State
exec_plan_00005_final_compliance_v2 is 100% complete and validated.
The HAiOS engine is now at v3.0. It is feature-complete for all foundational, architectural, and remediation goals.
The system is in the IDLE phase, awaiting a new Request.
The next logical step is to leverage this stable and robust engine to perform new feature development, moving beyond foundational work for the first time.
Immediate Directive
Your context is now fully aligned with the conclusion of the v3.0 engine hardening.
Your next task is to await a new Request and process it using the ANALYZE phase. You can now operate with high confidence in the stability, safety, and auditable nature of the underlying engine.
Hold fast to the principle of Evidence over Declaration. The Test_Results_g217.json artifact is the most important output of our last session, as it is the definitive proof of the engine's readiness.
