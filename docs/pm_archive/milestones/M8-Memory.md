# M8-Memory Milestone

## Overview

**ID:** M8-Memory
**Name:** Memory System Enhancement
**Status:** Defined (not started)
**Created:** Session 111

## Theme

Enhance the memory system: embeddings, retrieval algorithm, classification, feedback loops.

## Scope

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Embeddings | Complete concept/entity embedding coverage |
| Classification | Greek Triad adoption, type normalization |
| Retrieval | Algorithm intelligence, query optimization |
| Feedback | ReasoningBank feedback loop, usefulness signals |
| Safety | Synthesis safety measures, recovery mechanisms |

## Items

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| E2-017 | Concept Embedding Completion | pending |
| E2-018 | Entity Embedding Generation | pending |
| E2-019 | Concept Type Normalization | pending |
| E2-021 | Memory Reference Governance | pending |
| E2-028 | Greek Triad Classification Gap | pending |
| E2-068 | Async Query Rewriting Investigation | pending |
| E2-124 | Synthesis Safety Measures | pending |
| INV-014 | Memory Context Injection Architecture | pending |
| INV-015 | Retrieval Algorithm Intelligence | pending |
| INV-023 | ReasoningBank Feedback Loop Architecture | pending |

## Dependencies

- M7-Tooling should be substantially complete (tooling enables memory work)
- INV-029 should be resolved (milestone tracking needs to work)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% concept embedding coverage
- [ ] 100% entity embedding coverage
- [ ] Greek Triad classification adopted (>50% of new content)
- [ ] Retrieval relevance improved (qualitative assessment)
- [ ] ReasoningBank feedback loop operational
