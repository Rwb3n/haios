# Audit Action Items: Consolidated

**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Origin:** OODA Audit of Checkpoints & Handoffs

## 1. Immediate Updates (Documentation Hygiene)

- [ ] **Mark Large File Investigation RESOLVED:** Update `docs/handoff/2025-11-24-INVESTIGATION-REQUEST-large-json-files-skipped.md` header to status: RESOLVED.
- [ ] **Mark Gap Tasks COMPLETE:** Update `2025-12-04-TASK-data-quality-gaps.md` and `2025-12-03-TASK-gap-b3-llm-classification.md`.
- [ ] **Consolidate Session 27:** Clean up the 3 fragmented checkpoint files.

## 2. Archival Strategy (Reduce Noise)

- [ ] **Create Archive Dirs:** `docs/archive/checkpoints/` and `docs/archive/handoff/`.
- [ ] **Move Historical Checkpoints:** Move Sessions 2-20 (Nov 18-Dec 2) to archive.
- [ ] **Move Historical Handoffs:** Move all `2025-11-*` handoffs to archive (except active investigations if any).

## 3. Epistemic Verification

- [ ] **Verify `file-based-epoch-architecture.md` status:** Is this approved? If so, add to `epistemic_state.md` "Next Focus" section explicitly.
- [ ] **Link Reports:** Ensure these audit reports are linked from `docs/README.md` under "Reports".

## 4. Operational Adjustments

- [ ] **Enforce Naming Convention:** All future checkpoints must follow `YYYY-MM-DD-SESSION-XX-Title.md`.
- [ ] **Stop "Fragmented Checkpoints":** One checkpoint file per session, authoritative.
