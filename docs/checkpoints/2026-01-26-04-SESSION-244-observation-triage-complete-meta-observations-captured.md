pending:
- 4 new meta-observations pending triage (obs-244-03 through obs-244-06)
- 7 spawned work items need traces_to population (WORK-016 through WORK-022)
- Select next work from queue for implementation
drift_observed:
- observation-triage-cycle scans wrong location (work archive vs epoch obs)
- scaffold command --flags not parsed (AgentUX friction)
- spawned work items violate REQ-TRACE-002 (empty traces_to)
completed:
- 'WORK-015: RequirementExtractor Module - closed with full DoD'
- 'Observation triage: 13 observations processed, 7 work items spawned'
- 'Meta-observations: 4 captured about triage process itself'
