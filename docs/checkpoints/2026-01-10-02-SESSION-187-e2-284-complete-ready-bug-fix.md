drift_observed:
- plan_tree.py ready command used deprecated milestone taxonomy instead of scanning
  work files
- Milestone/Chapter fragmentation - system has accumulated layers that need svelte
  refactor
- S20 lines 96-97 target (implementation-cycle, close-work-cycle → 5 single-phase
  skills each) not yet addressed
completed:
- E2-284 (observation-capture-cycle 134→41 lines, observations.md 105→26 lines)
- Fixed just ready to scan work files directly (milestones deprecated)
- Form chapter updated (ARC-003, ARC-004 progress)
- Checkpoint template load_principles now empty by default
- Key insight: Inhale value is HIGH for investigation, LOW for implementation, MEDIUM
    for work selection
