> **Date:** 2025-12-11
> **Focus:** Work item spawning patterns and ADR-034 ontology implementation
> **Context:** Continued from Session 61 (ADR-034 accepted, E2-032/E2-009 created, INV-007 created)

## Session Summary

Completed INV-007 (Work Item Spawning Patterns) discovering two dimensions of work relationships: vertical (containment) and horizontal (generation). Amended ADR-033 with Section 2b for sibling spawning governance. Implemented E2-032 (ADR-034 Implementation) creating the `investigation` template, `/new-investigation` command, `docs/investigations/` directory, and updating CLAUDE.md with canonical lifecycle prefixes. E2-009 is now unblocked.

## Completed Work

### 1. INV-007: Work Item Spawning Patterns (COMPLETE)
- [x] Investigated spawning mechanisms in existing backlog patterns
- [x] Discovered vertical vs horizontal spawning distinction
- [x] Synthesized Closure Completeness Constraint
- [x] Amended ADR-033 with Section 2b (Sibling Spawning)
- [x] Added spawned_by, blocks, blocked_by to backlog_item validator
- [x] Stored findings to memory (concepts 70685-70688)

### 2. E2-032: ADR-034 Implementation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Created `investigation` template (.claude/templates/investigation.md)
- [x] Created `/new-investigation` command
- [x] Created docs/investigations/ directory with README
- [x] Deprecated handoff_investigation template (added notice)
- [x] Updated ValidateTemplate.ps1 with investigation template type
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with canonical lifecycle prefixes section
- [x] Updated templates README with deprecation notes
- [x] Stored findings to memory (concepts 70689-70691)

## Key Findings

1. **Two dimensions of spawning exist:** Vertical (containment - docs belong to items, governed by ADR-033) and Horizontal (generation - items create items, was ungoverned)
2. **Closure Completeness Constraint:** Investigations cannot close until all spawned work items exist and reference back via spawned_by field
3. **ADR-033 Section 2b fills the gap:** Formalizes horizontal spawning with spawned_by, blocks, blocked_by fields
4. **DISCOVERY phase now explicit:** investigation template + /new-investigation command make the phase governed
5. **Handoff is fully deprecated:** Replaced by checkpoint + backlog + memory + /coldstart pattern

---

## Pending Work (For Next Session)

1. **E2-009** (HIGH) - Lifecycle Sequence Enforcement - now unblocked by E2-032
2. **E2-FIX-001** (if not already complete) - Synthesis embedding backfill
3. Consider updating /close command to validate spawning references (ADR-033 Section 2b governance rule 3)

---

## Continuation Instructions

1. E2-009 is unblocked - read PLAN-E2-009-LIFECYCLE-SEQUENCE-ENFORCEMENT.md
2. Implement UserPromptSubmit hook logic to detect plan-creation intent
3. Check for prerequisite INVESTIGATION-* or ADR-* before allowing /new-plan
4. Add "skip discovery" override mechanism
