drift_observed:
- Agent re-verified injected context (token waste) - L4 gap in REQ-CONTEXT-001

  governance
- Survey-cycle pending → auto-continue logic not explicit in L4 requirements
completed:
- WORK-023 CLOSED (scan_incomplete_work status filtering fix)
- L4 observations captured (3 gaps identified)
- 3 tests added, 11/11 pass
