# Session 180 Checkpoint: Context Architecture Duality and Multi-Agent Vision

> **Date:** 2026-01-07
> **Focus:** Operator insight → staging concept → S23/S24 duality → multi-agent vision
> **Context:** Continuation from Session 179. Architectural exploration session.

---

## Session Summary

Operator introduced "staging" concept (military metaphor). Through dialogue, discovered this wasn't about adding a gate but about **context assembly** - the inhale counterpart to S23's exhale. Established S23/S24 duality: S23 = files as output (exhale), S24 = context assembly (inhale). Further realized this architecture scaffolds Epoch 4 multi-agent layer hierarchy where current manual layer-switching becomes inter-agent protocol.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Staging Concept Capture
- [x] Stored initial concept to memory (doxa, 81030-81038)
- [x] Queried memory for prior work (found "Readiness Check", "Pre-flight" concepts)
- [x] Created INV-060 work item with memory_refs
- [x] Created investigation document
- [x] Created S24-staging-pattern.md stub

### 2. Context Architecture Duality Discovery
- [x] Operator challenged: "is that really the whole question?"
- [x] Traced from gate → composition → context architecture
- [x] Identified S23 (exhale) needs S24 (inhale) counterpart
- [x] Stored duality insight to memory (episteme, 81039-81051)
- [x] Rewrote S24 from "Staging Pattern" to "Context Assembly (Inhale)"

### 3. Multi-Agent Vision
- [x] Realized current layer-switching is operator-steered
- [x] Mapped future: Human at L0-L2, Orchestrator at L3-L4, Workers at L5-L7
- [x] Stored vision to memory (episteme, 81052-81074)
- [x] Added Epoch 4: AUTONOMY section to L4-implementation.md
- [x] Added "Future: Multi-Agent Context" section to S24

## Files Modified This Session

```
.claude/haios/epochs/E2/architecture/S24-staging-pattern.md  # Created, then rewritten
.claude/haios/manifesto/L4-implementation.md                 # Added Epoch 4 section
docs/work/active/INV-060/WORK.md                             # Created
docs/work/active/INV-060/investigations/001-*.md             # Created
```

## Key Findings

1. **Staging is not a gate** - it's context assembly, the inhale before cognitive work
2. **S23/S24 duality** - S23 = exhale (produce artifact), S24 = inhale (assemble context)
3. **Agent capability is bounded by assembled context** - memory_refs MUST be queried
4. **Layer architecture exists now** - operator steers between L5-L7 (execution) and L3-L4 (architecture)
5. **Epoch 4 vision** - manual layer-switch becomes inter-agent protocol
6. **What we build now matters** - S23/S24, memory_refs, portals become multi-agent infrastructure

## WHY Captured (ADR-033)

| Decision/Learning | Memory ID | Source |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Staging concept (doxa) | 81030-81038 | Operator insight |
| S23/S24 context duality (episteme) | 81039-81051 | Session dialogue |
| Multi-agent layer vision (episteme) | 81052-81074 | Session synthesis |

---

## Session Verification (Yes/No)

| Question | Answer | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Was all planned work completed? | Yes | Architectural exploration, not implementation |
| Were tests run and passing? | N/A | No code changes |
| Any unplanned deviations? | Yes | Entire session was emergent from operator insight |
| WHY captured to memory? | Yes | 45 concepts stored |

---

## Pending Work (For Next Session)

1. **E2-271** (Skill Module Reference Cleanup) - Ready, 7 files
2. **INV-060** (Context Assembly investigation) - Validates S24 before committing arcs
3. **E2-280** (Wire ground-cycle) - Completes Ground chapter

---

## Continuation Instructions

1. Run `/coldstart`
2. E2-271 first (clears queue, documentation only)
3. Then INV-060 to validate S23/S24 duality
4. S24 is DRAFT - don't add to EPOCH.md foundational list until validated
5. Key memory_refs: 81039-81051 (duality), 81052-81074 (multi-agent)
