# Session 36: Governance Suite Documentation Synchronization

> **Navigation:** [Strategic Overview](../epistemic_state.md) | [Operations](../OPERATIONS.md)

## 1. Executive Summary
This session finalized the **Epoch 2 Governance Enablement** by synchronizing the project's documentation with the newly implemented system capabilities. We addressed "knowledge rot" where documentation lagged behind the rapid code evolution of Sessions 33-35. All major indices and the Operations Manual now accurately reflect the Governance Suite (Slash Commands, Scaffolding, Diagnostics).

## 2. Key Deliverables
-   **Updated `docs/epistemic_state.md`:** Recognized Session 36, Epoch 2 status, and resolved gaps.
-   **Updated `docs/OPERATIONS.md`:** Added "Governance & Workflow" section detailing `/coldstart`, `/new-plan`, etc.
-   **Updated `docs/README.md`:** Added Governance Suite to Quick Status.
-   **New Indices:**
    -   `docs/checkpoints/README.md`
    -   `docs/handoff/README.md`
    -   `docs/specs/README.md`
-   **Sub-Directory Updates:** `haios_etl/README.md`, `tests/README.md`, `scripts/README.md`.

## 3. System State Changes
-   **Governance:** Fully documented and operational.
-   **Epistemic State:** Aligned with reality (no known documentation gaps).

## 4. Next Steps (Epoch 2 Execution)
1.  **Cold Start Verification:** Begin next session with `/coldstart`.
2.  **Multi-Index Architecture:** Begin Phase 10 (Graph/Summary indices).
3.  **Agent Logic:** Refine agents using the new governance tools.

## 5. Decision Log
-   **DD-DOC-001:** `docs/specs/memory_db_schema_v3.sql` remains the authoritative source of truth for DB schema.
-   **DD-DOC-002:** Operations Manual now prioritizes Slash Commands over raw CLI usage for governance tasks.
