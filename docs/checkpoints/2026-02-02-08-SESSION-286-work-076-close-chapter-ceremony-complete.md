# Session 286: WORK-076 close-chapter-ceremony Complete

## Summary

Implemented close-chapter-ceremony skill, first of three ceremony skills from WORK-070 decomposition.

## Key Learnings

- Ceremony skills are simpler than work-cycle skills (3 phases vs 4)
- Chapters don't need memory capture (WHY at work item level)
- Decomposition unblocks progress (>3 file rule)

## Next

WORK-077 (close-arc-ceremony) unblocked and ready.
