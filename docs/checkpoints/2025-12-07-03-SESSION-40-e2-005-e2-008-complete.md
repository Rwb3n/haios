## Session Summary

Session 40 completed two major backlog items (E2-005, E2-008) and approved ADR-030. Key meta-learning: caught myself bypassing governance lifecycle when adding template types - paused, analyzed properly, then executed correctly.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. ADR-030 Approved
- Option D (Hybrid Taxonomy) accepted
- Document updated with approval status
- Stored to memory (Concept 62537)

### 2. E2-005: haios-status.json Auto-Update
- Created `UpdateHaiosStatus.ps1` with 7 data sources
- Sources: templates, memory stats, backlog, checkpoints, plans, ADR, handoff
- Live file tracking for files in-transit through lifecycle
- Backlog alignment checking
- Wired into `/haios` command

### 3. E2-008: Template Validation Schema Sync
- **Process discipline applied:** OBSERVE -> ANALYZE -> DECIDE -> EXECUTE
- Analyzed structures of disputed types (handoff, handoff_investigation, proposal)
- Confirmed structurally distinct (not naming variants)
- Removed `investigation_handoff` alias
- Migrated 3 files to canonical `handoff_investigation`
- Total templates: 14

### 4. Governance Principles Stored
- Concept 62535: "Make the right thing the easy thing"
- Concept 62536: "Template as Schema"
- Concept 62539: Governance is "scaffolding not structure" - Level 2 achieved
- Concept 62540: Dashboard insight - ceremony vs action
- Concept 62541: E2-008 process lesson

## Key Findings

1. **Governance maturity is Level 2 (Guidance)** - soft prompts, not hard blocks
2. **Dashboard is verification infrastructure** - proves system works, doesn't drive action
3. **Template types must be structurally distinct** - naming variants should consolidate
4. **Process discipline matters** - OBSERVE-ANALYZE-DECIDE-EXECUTE prevents hasty mistakes
5. **/coldstart should invoke /haios** - unified initialization (queued for E2-002)

## Pending Work (For Next Session)

1. **E2-006:** File Lifecycle Governance (create lifecycle_phase templates)
2. **E2-001/E2-002:** Memory-Governance Integration (in_progress)
3. **E2-007:** Behavioral Wrapper Hooks
4. **V-001:** Governance Effectiveness Validation (deferred, not blocking)

---

## Continuation Instructions

1. Run `/coldstart` to initialize
2. Review backlog - E2-006 is next logical item
3. E2-006 requires: create templates for each lifecycle phase per ADR-030
4. Remember: follow OBSERVE-ANALYZE-DECIDE-EXECUTE for any schema changes
