# Anti-Patterns Directory

> **Progressive Disclosure:** [Quick Reference](../README.md) -> [Strategic Overview](../epistemic_state.md) -> **Anti-Patterns (YOU ARE HERE)**

---

## Purpose

This directory documents anti-patterns discovered during HAIOS development. These patterns represent common failure modes that agents (and humans) should actively avoid.

---

## Active Anti-Patterns

| ID | Name | Severity | Description |
|----|------|----------|-------------|
| [AP-STALE-FOOTER](AP-STALE-FOOTER.md) | Stale Footer | MEDIUM | Agents update headers but leave footers stale |

---

## Anti-Pattern Structure

Each anti-pattern document follows this structure:

1. **Description** - What the anti-pattern is
2. **Symptoms** - How to recognize it
3. **Root Cause** - Why it happens
4. **Prevention** - How to avoid it
5. **Detection** - How to find existing instances
6. **Examples** - Before/after comparisons
7. **Related Patterns** - Connections to other patterns

---

## Contributing

1. Create file: `AP-<SHORT-NAME>.md`
2. Follow the template structure
3. Add entry to this index
4. Add concept to memory database (optional)
5. Link from relevant documentation
