Decomposition & Reverse Engineering of "CodePilot Studio" for HAiOS
This UI provides a high-level dashboard and control panel for managing AI agents and their work on a software project.
1. Screen: Overview / Dashboard
UI Elements:
KPIs: Active Sessions, Running Agents, Git Branches, Project Goals.
Project Details: Repo Path, Created/Modified Dates, Link to GitHub.
Recent Sessions: A list of recent work sessions.
Git Status: Current Branch, Last Commit.
Active Agents: A monitor showing agent statuses (Total, Active, Success Rate).
Current Goals: A list of high-level goals.
Quick Actions: "Create New Session".
Mapping to haios Schemas:
KPIs:
"Project Goals" count could come from the number of init_plan_*.txt files with status: "ACTIVE" or status: "APPROVED".
"Git Branches" would require an external tool integration (git CLI), but the OS could track the current_branch in state.txt.
Project Details: This is high-level info. The repository_path would be a startup parameter for the OS itself. created/last_modified could be file system metadata or tracked in global_project_summary.txt.
Recent Sessions: This maps beautifully to our concept of Execution Plans. "Recent Sessions" could be a list of the most recently updated exec_plan_*.txt files.
Active Agents / Agent Status Monitor: This implies a layer above our current OS file structure â€“ an Agent Orchestrator that manages the lifecycle of the agent "processes" themselves. Our OS files would be the "work orders" and "state database" for this orchestrator. The "Success Rate" could be derived from Execution Plan statuses (COMPLETED_SUCCESS vs. FAILED).
** future considerations: a traffic controller agent that supports the managers and supervisors, where each execution plan could be a card in a kanban board that could be move around in a multi dimensional queue system?**
Current Goals: This directly maps to the overall_goal field in active init_plan_*.txt files.
Quick Actions: "Create New Session" could be a UI wrapper for creating a Request to start a new Execution Plan.
2. Screen: Git Status
UI Elements: Repo Status (modified, new, deleted files), Branch List (local/remote), Search/Sort, Merge functionality.
Mapping to haios Schemas:
This is almost entirely an integration with an external tool (git). The OS doesn't track this level of file diffing directly.
However, our global_registry_map.txt tracks which artifacts were modified by which task (history log). The UI could use git status for the raw file state and then cross-reference with our registry_map.txt to show why a file was modified (e.g., "Modified by task task_xyz as part of exec_plan_abc"). This links git status to project intent.
The branch names (codex/add-claude...) imply a feature-branching strategy, which could be driven by our Execution Plans. An Execution Plan's ID or goal could be used to generate the branch name.
3. Screen: Agents
UI Elements: Agent Management dashboard. Cards for each agent type ("Code Assistant", "Test Runner"). Status (Idle), Capabilities (code generation, test execution), stats (Tasks Completed), Deploy button.
Mapping to haios Schemas:
This screen is pure Agent Orchestrator UI. It's about managing the "workers," not the "work."
The "Capabilities" directly map to the ability to execute Execution Plans of a certain plan_type.
"Code Assistant" (Claude) executes DEVELOPMENT, REMEDIATION, and SCAFFOLDING plans.
"Test Runner" executes TEST_EXECUTION plans.
We could envision a "Critique Agent" (GPT-o3) that executes PLAN_CRITIQUE or TEST_SCRIPT_CRITIQUE plans.
"Tasks Completed" for an agent could be derived by querying all exec_plan_*.txt files and counting tasks that were completed by that agent persona (if we add an agent_persona_used field to the task execution log).
4. Screen: Architect
UI Elements: "Goal Analysis". A text area to "Describe Your Goal". Quick action buttons ("Add authentication", "Implement search"). "Analyze Goal" button.
Mapping to haios Schemas:
This screen is a sophisticated UI for creating a Request.
"Describe Your Goal" maps directly to the full_request_payload of a request_<g>.txt file.
The "Quick Actions" could be pre-canned Request templates. Clicking "Add authentication" would pre-populate the goal description with a standard request for adding authentication.
The "Analyze Goal" button triggers the entire ANALYZE phase in our OS. The UI would then likely show the Analysis Report that the OS generates as a result.
5. Screen: Sessions
UI Elements: List of sessions, each with a status ("running"), start time, and Pause/Delete buttons. "New Session" button.
Mapping to haios Schemas:
"Session" seems to be a high-level concept, possibly mapping to an Initiative Plan or a long-running Execution Plan. Let's assume a "Session" is an active work context, which could be an Initiative Plan.
The list would be generated by reading all init_plan_*.txt files from the os_root/initiatives/ directory.
The "running" status comes from the status field inside the init_plan_*.txt file.
"Start time" comes from the g_created field (or a real timestamp if we add it).
The "New Session" button could trigger the "Architect" view to define a new goal, which then creates a new Initiative Plan.
6. Screen: Terminal (Welcome to Claude!)
UI Elements: A direct, interactive terminal session with a specific agent ("Claude", the Code Assistant).
Mapping to haios Schemas:
This is the "low-level" view of the CONSTRUCT phase.
The AI's opening prompt, "I'll help you with the Meow project. What specific task would you like me to work on?" is a bit more conversational than our rigid AI_Execute_Next_Viable_Task_From_Active_Plan() action.
This implies that even within the CONSTRUCT phase, there can be a human-in-the-loop providing clarification.
How to reconcile this? The AI could still be executing a task from an Execution Plan. Let's say the task is "Implement Login UI." The agent might start by saying, "I'm starting task task_login_ui. Here's my plan for the first step: create the LoginPage.tsx file. Does that sound right?" The human can then provide feedback. The "chat" becomes the real-time log of the CONSTRUCT phase for that task. The structured updates to the OS Control Files still happen in the background based on the outcome of this interaction.
The "Tips for getting started" (e.g., "Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file") implies that an agent session can have its own configuration, which could be an Execution Plan or a sub-task.
Reverse-Engineered Improvements & Ideas for HAiOS:
Agent Orchestrator Layer: This UI makes it clear that there's a layer above our file-based OS that manages agent processes. Our OS provides the "database" and "work orders" for this orchestrator. We don't need to model the orchestrator itself, but we should ensure our schemas serve it well.
Explicit agent_persona fields: In Execution Plans, at the plan or task level, having a field like "assigned_agent_persona": "CODING_ASSISTANT" | "TEST_RUNNER" | "CRITIQUE_AGENT" would make the orchestrator's job easier. It would know which agent "vessel" to deploy for that task.
"Goal" vs. "Initiative": The UI uses "Goals" and "Sessions." This maps well to our "Initiatives." We should stick with our terminology (Initiative Plan) but recognize it powers a UI that might call it a "Goal" or "Session."
human_attention_queue.txt (from our Goldratt discussion): This becomes even more critical. The UI Dashboard could have a big, flashing "Awaiting Your Input" card that is directly populated from this queue file.
Interactive CONSTRUCT: The terminal view suggests that a task in an Execution Plan isn't a "fire and forget" command for the AI. It's the topic for a work session. The AI can still ask clarifying questions related to that specific task. The execution_checklist becomes the agent's to-do list for that session.
Need for a Global agent_registry.txt?: Similar to how the UI shows a list of available agents, the OS might need a file that defines the known agent personas and their capabilities (e.g., {"agent_id": "CLAUDE_CODER_V3", "persona": "CODING_ASSISTANT", "capabilities": ["DEVELOPMENT", "SCAFFOLDING", "REMEDIATION"]}). This could be part of haios.config.json or a separate file.
