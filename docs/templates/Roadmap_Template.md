## 4. **Assumptions & Constraints**

- [Explicit listâ€”every technical, organizational, or environmental assumption, each annotated:]
  - [ ] *Assumption:* "X will be available by week 4" (**Confidence:** Medium; **Self-critique:** "X has slipped before. If delayed, block Y.")
  - [ ] *Constraint:* "All agents must use strict mode for phase 1" (**Confidence:** High)

## 5. **Dependencies & Risks**

- [Linked list, each with confidence/mitigation plan.]
  - [ ] *Dependency:* "Postgres v15 feature Z is live in prod" (**Mitigation:** fallback to v14 APIs)
