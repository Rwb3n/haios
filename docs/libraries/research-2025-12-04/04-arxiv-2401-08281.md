  title: "The Faiss library"
  type: "library"
  accessed: "2025-12-04"

summary:
  one_liner: "A comprehensive library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, including methods for vector compression and transformation."
  key_concepts:
    - "Vector Similarity Search"
    - "Vector Compression (PQ, OPQ)"
    - "Vector Transformation (PCA)"
    - "Clustering (K-means)"
  architecture: "C++ core with Python bindings, providing various index types for different trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and memory."

relevance_to_haios:
  output_pipeline: "Provides low-level primitives for transforming the vector space itself (e.g., reducing dimensionality via PCA) to make the Output Pipeline more efficient."
  feedback_capture: "Not directly relevant."
  epoch_management: "Can be used to build efficient, compressed indices for each Epoch, ensuring that even as knowledge grows, retrieval remains fast."
  utility_increase: "Directly increases utility by reducing latency and memory footprint of the knowledge base."
  relevance_score: 4

technical_patterns:
  - name: "Vector Transformation Pipeline"
    description: "Chaining transformations (e.g., PCA -> PQ) to optimize embeddings for storage and retrieval."
    code_example: "index = faiss.IndexPreTransform(pca_matrix, sub_index)"
    applicable_to: "Memory Optimization / Indexing Layer"

gaps:
  - "Low-level tool, doesn't address the semantic 'meaning' of the knowledge, only its vector representation."

quotes:
  - text: "Faiss is a toolkit of indexing methods and related primitives used to search, cluster, compress and transform vectors."
    context: "Confirming that 'transformation' is a core capability, even if just mathematical."
