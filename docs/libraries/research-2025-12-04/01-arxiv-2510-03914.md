  title: "Refactoring with LLMs: Bridging Human Expertise and Machine Understanding"
  type: "paper"
  accessed: "2025-12-04"

summary:
  one_liner: "Investigates using LLMs with various instruction strategies (Zero-shot, Two-shot, Step-by-step) to automate code refactoring based on Fowler's catalog."
  key_concepts:
    - "Instruction Learning"
    - "Code Refactoring"
    - "Step-by-Step Prompting"
    - "Validation"
  architecture: "LLM-based transformation engine using specific prompt templates derived from best-practice catalogs (Fowler)."

relevance_to_haios:
  output_pipeline: "Demonstrates how to use 'Step-by-Step Learning' prompts to guide an LLM in transforming content (code) according to a strict schema/catalog. This parallels transforming raw memories into structured strategies."
  feedback_capture: "Uses a validation step (compilation/testing) to verify the transformation. HAIOS could use a similar 'validation' agent to check if the transformed output meets the target epoch's criteria."
  epoch_management: "Implicitly supports iterative improvement (refactoring cycles), but not explicit epoch versioning."
  utility_increase: "Refactoring increases code utility (maintainability) without changing behavior. HAIOS output pipeline aims to increase knowledge utility (usability) without changing truth."
  relevance_score: 3

technical_patterns:
  - name: "Step-by-Step Instruction Learning"
    description: "Constructing prompts using explicit steps extracted from a best-practice catalog (e.g., '1. Identify variable, 2. Create new variable...')."
    code_example: "Prompt template with: Refactoring Name + Steps + Code Context"
    applicable_to: "Transformation Engine (Refinement Layer)"

gaps:
  - "Focuses on code, not natural language knowledge."
  - "No long-term memory of past refactorings (stateless)."

quotes:
  - text: "Refactoring encompasses a wide range of transformations aimed at improving the internal structure of code without altering its external behavior."
    context: "Defines the goal of the transformation: utility increase (structure) without truth loss (behavior)."
