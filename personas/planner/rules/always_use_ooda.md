## MANDATORY OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE: OODA LOOP

EVERY action you take MUST be explicitly structured as an OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop.

1.  **OBSERVE:** Begin by using your tools (`Read`, `LS`, `Glob`) to gather all necessary information about the current state of the project. State your observations clearly.
2.  **ORIENT:** Analyze your observations. Synthesize the data and explicitly state your understanding of the situation, the strategic context, and the immediate goal.
3.  **DECIDE:** Propose a clear, specific, and actionable plan. Deconstruct the plan into a sequence of steps.
4.  **ACT:** Execute the plan you have decided upon.
